It all started with a high-voltage electricity line 10,500 km long. Now, 30 years later, that network stretches to more than 42,000 km with a workforce of over 1,700 people. They objective is to guarantee the safe and continuous supply of electricity throughout Spain, and to develop a reliable transport network to support social progress.

Law 54/1997 regarding the electricity sector confirmed Red Eléctrica's role as key in the operation of the system, and Law 17/2007 confirmed Red Eléctrica as the sole transmission agent and operator of the Spanish electricity system carrying out its functions under a regime of exclusivity.

During 2010, and in accordance with this Law, the acquisition of the transmission assets from the electric utility companies was completed, including those assets of the Balearic Islands' and the Canary Islands' systems and it represented the consolidation of the Company as the sole transmission agent, converting it into the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of the Spanish electricity system.

It all started with a high-voltage electricity line 10,500 km long. Now, 30 years later, that network stretches to more than 42,000 km with a workforce of over 1,700 people. They objective is to guarantee the safe and continuous supply of electricity throughout Spain, and to develop a reliable transport network to support social progress.

Law 54/1997 regarding the electricity sector confirmed Red Eléctrica's role as key in the operation of the system, and Law 17/2007 confirmed Red Eléctrica as the sole transmission agent and operator of the Spanish electricity system carrying out its functions under a regime of exclusivity.

During 2010, and in accordance with this Law, the acquisition of the transmission assets from the electric utility companies was completed, including those assets of the Balearic Islands' and the Canary Islands' systems and it represented the consolidation of the Company as the sole transmission agent, converting it into the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of the Spanish electricity system.

Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

In its early years, the company engaged in construction of dam-related projects such as the Kisofukushima No. 2 Hydroelectric Power Plant (completed in 1919). Maeda Corporation was established in 1946.
　Later, Maeda used electric blasting for safe construction of the Tagokura Dam (completed in 1960). The Arimine Dam (completed in 1961) was successfully constructed despite extremely adverse environmental conditions. For construction of the Takase Dam (completed in 1979), a computer network linking the company's head office with the construction site was quickly created to support of operation of heavy machinery and quality control, and stones were piled on the dam slope to create a structure in harmony with local scenery. In this way, Maeda established its status as one of Japan's leading dam builders. The Technical Research Laboratory was established in 1976.
Maeda also actively developed its overseas business, receiving orders for a landfill project in Hong Kong in 1963 and construction of the Asian Highway in Thailand in 1965.
Maeda acquired ISO 14001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2001, began to hold a Zero Emissions Liaison Conference in 2002, and completed registration for acquisition of ISO 9001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2003. In addition, in 2006, Maeda issued the first CSR report in the Japanese construction industry and was ranked first in the industry in the Third Quality Management Level Research in 2007. The company also completed construction of The Tokyo Towers, a high-rise, twin-tower condominium complex (completed in 2008).
　Overseas developments include subway construction in Hong Kong and Taiwan that is currently underway and plant construction for Japanese companies in Thailand. Maeda is focusing on infrastructure development projects mainly in the Asian countries including India, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. Since its foundation in 1919, Maeda has constructed high-quality structures safely and in strict compliance with deadlines in accordance with our corporate motto ""Sincerity, Willpower, and Technology."" Since 2009, the company has been working in a concerted effort to become number one in environmental management. (3)",Japan,japan,

In its early years, the company engaged in construction of dam-related projects such as the Kisofukushima No. 2 Hydroelectric Power Plant (completed in 1919). Maeda Corporation was established in 1946.
　Later, Maeda used electric blasting for safe construction of the Tagokura Dam (completed in 1960). The Arimine Dam (completed in 1961) was successfully constructed despite extremely adverse environmental conditions. For construction of the Takase Dam (completed in 1979), a computer network linking the company's head office with the construction site was quickly created to support of operation of heavy machinery and quality control, and stones were piled on the dam slope to create a structure in harmony with local scenery. In this way, Maeda established its status as one of Japan's leading dam builders. The Technical Research Laboratory was established in 1976.
Maeda also actively developed its overseas business, receiving orders for a landfill project in Hong Kong in 1963 and construction of the Asian Highway in Thailand in 1965.
Maeda acquired ISO 14001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2001, began to hold a Zero Emissions Liaison Conference in 2002, and completed registration for acquisition of ISO 9001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2003. In addition, in 2006, Maeda issued the first CSR report in the Japanese construction industry and was ranked first in the industry in the Third Quality Management Level Research in 2007. The company also completed construction of The Tokyo Towers, a high-rise, twin-tower condominium complex (completed in 2008).
　Overseas developments include subway construction in Hong Kong and Taiwan that is currently underway and plant construction for Japanese companies in Thailand. Maeda is focusing on infrastructure development projects mainly in the Asian countries including India, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. Since its foundation in 1919, Maeda has constructed high-quality structures safely and in strict compliance with deadlines in accordance with our corporate motto ""Sincerity, Willpower, and Technology."" Since 2009, the company has been working in a concerted effort to become number one in environmental management. (3)",Japan,japan,

- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips had operations and activities in 17 countries, and approximately 13,100 employees as of March 31, 2017.
 
ConocoPhillips China Inc. (COPC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips undertaking oil and gas exploration and production operations in China through cooperation with Chinese and international partners. At present, COPC has offices in Beijing and Tanggu.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　
In Bohai Bay, ConocoPhillips is jointly developing one of China's largest offshore oilfields, the Peng Lai 19-3 field, as well as the nearby Peng Lai 19-9 and Peng Lai 25-6 fields in Block 11/05 with our co-venturer, CNOOC. Under the terms of the production sharing contract (PSC), operatorship of the Penglai fields was transferred to CNOOC on July 1, 2014. ConocoPhillips continues to maintain its interest as a non-operator. In the South China Sea, Xijiang 24-3 was COPC’s first offshore China field to go into production in 1994. A year later, the second Xijiang field (30-2) came on stream. In 1997, COPC developed a satellite of the 24-3 field (24-1) using extended-reach drilling technology and setting several world drilling records in the process. In 2010, ConocoPhillips’ ownership rights in the Xijiang fields ended. With the acquisition of Burlington Resources on March 31, 2006, COPC expanded its portfolio to include ownership in Block 15/34 in the South China Sea. This block contains three oil fields – Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6, and is operated by CNOOC.
 
ConocoPhillips also collaborates with Chinese oil companies globally. In Queensland, Australia, ConocoPhillips, Sinopec and Origin Energy are jointly developing the APLNG project that provides LNG to China.",United States of America ,united-states-of-america,

We do not extend soft loans but are ready to share risks by providing long-term financing for promising projects in challenging markets, where commercial financing is hard to obtain. Our funding can be in the form of equity capital, mezzanine financing or long-term investment loans. Regardless of the form of financing, we always participate with a minority stake. 
Apart from our risk capital, we bring in links to our network of development finance institutions and other potential co-financiers as well as our experience from financing and joint venture arrangements in developing countries. While most of our investments are in manufacturing, we also finance other sectors ranging from agribusiness and power generation to telecommunications and services.

- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

They together founded Italian-Thai Development Corporation Limited (ITD) on 15 August 1958 with an initial registered capital of 2 million Baht. The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited. Further growth to this date has brought the registered capital of the company up to 5,871.15 million Baht with 5,279.84 million Baht paid up.
             After the sad passing of Mr. Giorgio Berlingieri in December 1981, ITD has been under an all-Thai management led by the Karnasuta family members together with a strong team of competent Thai managers and engineers.
            The financial crisis starting in Thailand in 1997 dealt a big blow to almost all of the Thai companies. ITD was no exception and had to undergo a Business Rehabilitation process which was successfully carried out on 16 December 2002. That event turned out to be a foundation for a firmer growth of the company. At the year-end of 2003 ITD's turnover of that year was 18,330 million Baht making ITD the largest infrastructure construction company in Thailand and one of the largest in Southeast Asia """,Thailand,thailand,

They together founded Italian-Thai Development Corporation Limited (ITD) on 15 August 1958 with an initial registered capital of 2 million Baht. The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited. Further growth to this date has brought the registered capital of the company up to 5,871.15 million Baht with 5,279.84 million Baht paid up.
             After the sad passing of Mr. Giorgio Berlingieri in December 1981, ITD has been under an all-Thai management led by the Karnasuta family members together with a strong team of competent Thai managers and engineers.
            The financial crisis starting in Thailand in 1997 dealt a big blow to almost all of the Thai companies. ITD was no exception and had to undergo a Business Rehabilitation process which was successfully carried out on 16 December 2002. That event turned out to be a foundation for a firmer growth of the company. At the year-end of 2003 ITD's turnover of that year was 18,330 million Baht making ITD the largest infrastructure construction company in Thailand and one of the largest in Southeast Asia """,Thailand,thailand,

thousands-protest-against-proposed-nuclear-reprocessing-plant-in-lianyungang-jiangsu-china,http://www.cnnc.com.cn,,china-national-nuclear-corporation133,China National Nuclear Corporation,,,CNNC,,"The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is involved in the development of China’s nuclear energy programs, both civilian and military. Comprised of over one hundred subsidiaries and research institutions, CNNC controls most nuclear sector business, including research and development, design, uranium exploration and mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal.[2]

On 16 September 1988 China’s National People’s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China’s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry’s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a “virtual monopoly” on nuclear power development in China.[7]

In the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China’s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations “of squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects."" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC’s current president.[8]

In June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed the “Nuclear Power Safety and Radioactive Pollution Prevention” of the twelfth Five Year Plan and the 2020 targets, with a view toward strengthening nuclear safety.[10]

The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

It all started with a high-voltage electricity line 10,500 km long. Now, 30 years later, that network stretches to more than 42,000 km with a workforce of over 1,700 people. They objective is to guarantee the safe and continuous supply of electricity throughout Spain, and to develop a reliable transport network to support social progress.

Law 54/1997 regarding the electricity sector confirmed Red Eléctrica's role as key in the operation of the system, and Law 17/2007 confirmed Red Eléctrica as the sole transmission agent and operator of the Spanish electricity system carrying out its functions under a regime of exclusivity.

During 2010, and in accordance with this Law, the acquisition of the transmission assets from the electric utility companies was completed, including those assets of the Balearic Islands' and the Canary Islands' systems and it represented the consolidation of the Company as the sole transmission agent, converting it into the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of the Spanish electricity system.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips had operations and activities in 17 countries, and approximately 13,100 employees as of March 31, 2017.
 
ConocoPhillips China Inc. (COPC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips undertaking oil and gas exploration and production operations in China through cooperation with Chinese and international partners. At present, COPC has offices in Beijing and Tanggu.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　
In Bohai Bay, ConocoPhillips is jointly developing one of China's largest offshore oilfields, the Peng Lai 19-3 field, as well as the nearby Peng Lai 19-9 and Peng Lai 25-6 fields in Block 11/05 with our co-venturer, CNOOC. Under the terms of the production sharing contract (PSC), operatorship of the Penglai fields was transferred to CNOOC on July 1, 2014. ConocoPhillips continues to maintain its interest as a non-operator. In the South China Sea, Xijiang 24-3 was COPC’s first offshore China field to go into production in 1994. A year later, the second Xijiang field (30-2) came on stream. In 1997, COPC developed a satellite of the 24-3 field (24-1) using extended-reach drilling technology and setting several world drilling records in the process. In 2010, ConocoPhillips’ ownership rights in the Xijiang fields ended. With the acquisition of Burlington Resources on March 31, 2006, COPC expanded its portfolio to include ownership in Block 15/34 in the South China Sea. This block contains three oil fields – Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6, and is operated by CNOOC.

de Galicia). Actualmente, Unión Fenosa hace parte de uno de los dos grandes grupos españoles que dominan el petróleo-gas-electricidad en Europa oriental:
- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

The acquisition of a portfolio of water rights in Portugal marked the entry into the international RES business in 1990. Over the following years the projects were developed in a joint venture with the US utility company, Pennsylvania Power & Light (‘PPL’). Spain followed as a 2nd market in 1996, the portfolio eventually consisted of 17 small-hydropower plants in early 2000.

In mid 2000 the company extended its activities to wind and several new markets. In 2004 Hydrocontracting merged its Portuguese hydropower plants with the assets of Spanish Minicentrales Dos S.A. under the new name of RP Global. PPL’s share was bought back and the portfolio was successfully refinanced on the capital markets with a 30-year AAA–rated bond.

In 2011 the Hydrocontracting Group split from its Spanish partner, Minicentrales Dos, and became the sole owner of RP Global, holding 100% of the Group’s assets.""

- BSCH-Unión Fenosa-Riyal-CEPSA.
- BBVA-ENDESA-Iberdrola-REPSOL.
Inicialmente, el grupo se centró en el sector eléctrico y posteriormente, en 2000, sus negocios se han expandido hacia otras áreas energéticas, como el gas (mediante el contrato con la empresa egipcia Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) y hacia otros sectores como los servicios profesionales y de ingeniería, también en 2000 (mediante la creación de Soluziona). Las principales actividades de Unión Fenosa son la generación, la distribución y la comercialización de energía (electricidad y gas) en España, aunque dispone también de plantas de producción y áreas de distribución eléctrica en otros países.
En 1986 inició su expansión internacional mediante algunos contratos de ingeniería relacionadas con el sector eléctrico y en 1992 se realizó la primera inversión directa en el exterior.

On 16 September 1988 China’s National People’s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China’s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry’s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a “virtual monopoly” on nuclear power development in China.[7]

In the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China’s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations “of squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects."" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC’s current president.[8]

In June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed the “Nuclear Power Safety and Radioactive Pollution Prevention” of the twelfth Five Year Plan and the 2020 targets, with a view toward strengthening nuclear safety.[10]
