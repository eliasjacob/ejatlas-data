_x000D_
It all started with a high-voltage electricity line 10,500 km long. Now, 30 years later, that network stretches to more than 42,000 km with a workforce of over 1,700 people. They objective is to guarantee the safe and continuous supply of electricity throughout Spain, and to develop a reliable transport network to support social progress._x000D_
_x000D_
Law 54/1997 regarding the electricity sector confirmed Red Eléctrica's role as key in the operation of the system, and Law 17/2007 confirmed Red Eléctrica as the sole transmission agent and operator of the Spanish electricity system carrying out its functions under a regime of exclusivity._x000D_
_x000D_
During 2010, and in accordance with this Law, the acquisition of the transmission assets from the electric utility companies was completed, including those assets of the Balearic Islands' and the Canary Islands' systems and it represented the consolidation of the Company as the sole transmission agent, converting it into the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of the Spanish electricity system._x000D_

In its early years, the company engaged in construction of dam-related projects such as the Kisofukushima No. 2 Hydroelectric Power Plant (completed in 1919). Maeda Corporation was established in 1946._x000D_
　Later, Maeda used electric blasting for safe construction of the Tagokura Dam (completed in 1960). The Arimine Dam (completed in 1961) was successfully constructed despite extremely adverse environmental conditions. For construction of the Takase Dam (completed in 1979), a computer network linking the company's head office with the construction site was quickly created to support of operation of heavy machinery and quality control, and stones were piled on the dam slope to create a structure in harmony with local scenery. In this way, Maeda established its status as one of Japan's leading dam builders. The Technical Research Laboratory was established in 1976._x000D_
Maeda also actively developed its overseas business, receiving orders for a landfill project in Hong Kong in 1963 and construction of the Asian Highway in Thailand in 1965._x000D_
Maeda acquired ISO 14001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2001, began to hold a Zero Emissions Liaison Conference in 2002, and completed registration for acquisition of ISO 9001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2003. In addition, in 2006, Maeda issued the first CSR report in the Japanese construction industry and was ranked first in the industry in the Third Quality Management Level Research in 2007. The company also completed construction of The Tokyo Towers, a high-rise, twin-tower condominium complex (completed in 2008)._x000D_
　Overseas developments include subway construction in Hong Kong and Taiwan that is currently underway and plant construction for Japanese companies in Thailand. Maeda is focusing on infrastructure development projects mainly in the Asian countries including India, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. Since its foundation in 1919, Maeda has constructed high-quality structures safely and in strict compliance with deadlines in accordance with our corporate motto ""Sincerity, Willpower, and Technology."" Since 2009, the company has been working in a concerted effort to become number one in environmental management. (3)",Japan,japan,

The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

http://www.cnnc.com.cn,,thousands-protest-against-proposed-nuclear-reprocessing-plant-in-lianyungang-jiangsu-china,China National Nuclear Corporation,,,CNNC,,"The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is involved in the development of China’s nuclear energy programs, both civilian and military. Comprised of over one hundred subsidiaries and research institutions, CNNC controls most nuclear sector business, including research and development, design, uranium exploration and mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal.[2]_x000D_
_x000D_
On 16 September 1988 China’s National People’s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China’s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry’s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a “virtual monopoly” on nuclear power development in China.[7]_x000D_
_x000D_
In the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China’s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations “of squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects."" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC’s current president.[8]_x000D_
_x000D_
In June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed the “Nuclear Power Safety and Radioactive Pollution Prevention” of the twelfth Five Year Plan and the 2020 targets, with a view toward strengthening nuclear safety.[10]_x000D_

They together founded Italian-Thai Development Corporation Limited (ITD) on 15 August 1958 with an initial registered capital of 2 million Baht. The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

They together founded Italian-Thai Development Corporation Limited (ITD) on 15 August 1958 with an initial registered capital of 2 million Baht. The company grew steadily and became publicly listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1994 with a registered capital of 2,500 million Baht and with the name changed to Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited. Further growth to this date has brought the registered capital of the company up to 5,871.15 million Baht with 5,279.84 million Baht paid up._x000D_
             After the sad passing of Mr. Giorgio Berlingieri in December 1981, ITD has been under an all-Thai management led by the Karnasuta family members together with a strong team of competent Thai managers and engineers._x000D_
            The financial crisis starting in Thailand in 1997 dealt a big blow to almost all of the Thai companies. ITD was no exception and had to undergo a Business Rehabilitation process which was successfully carried out on 16 December 2002. That event turned out to be a foundation for a firmer growth of the company. At the year-end of 2003 ITD's turnover of that year was 18,330 million Baht making ITD the largest infrastructure construction company in Thailand and one of the largest in Southeast Asia """,Thailand,thailand,

Comprised of over one hundred subsidiaries and research institutions, CNNC controls most nuclear sector business, including research and development, design, uranium exploration and mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal.[2]_x000D_
_x000D_
On 16 September 1988 China’s National People’s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China’s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry’s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a “virtual monopoly” on nuclear power development in China.[7]_x000D_
_x000D_
In the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China’s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations “of squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects."" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC’s current president.[8]_x000D_
_x000D_
In June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed the “Nuclear Power Safety and Radioactive Pollution Prevention” of the twelfth Five Year Plan and the 2020 targets, with a view toward strengthening nuclear safety.[10]_x000D_
