</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">On 29<sup>th</sup> July 2019 small-scale farmers began
protesting, continuously through days and nights, with a sit-in in front of the
district’s planning administration (Satara Collector Office) against the
expansion of Karad Airport in Maharashtra State, India.[1] The farmers who
started the sit-in (Thiyya Aandola) announced they would continue their protest
until the government meets their demands and cancels the expansion project.[2] They
submitted details of their concerns to the Satara Collector and the CMO (Chief
Minister’s Office). This agitation is the latest in the ongoing resistance of
farmers opposing the airport expansion for more than 8 years, since 2011. The
protests take place under the aegis of the socio-political organization Shramik
Mukti Dal.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The farmers claim that the expansion will not help the
development of the district, but on the contrary, will lead to their
impoverishment: For expansion of an existing airstrip into a fully-fledged
airport next to the city of Karad, fertile and irrigated farm-land will be
acquired. Vinayak Shinde, spokesperson of the affected villagers and activist
of Shramik Mukti Dal, says that 1,335.46 hectares of farmland cultivated with
an irrigation-system are under threat. Critical infrastructure for the
irrigation system is located on the land to be acquired. Shinde said: Residents
of the villages of Warunji, Kese, Munde, Padali, Gote and Supane have worked to
develop this irrigation scheme for more than 50 years, explains Shinde, saying “If
the land acquisition is carried out this will be a huge loss for about 25,000
people who depend upon this agriculture.[1]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">On 30<sup>th</sup> August, after the villagers had
maintained their protest for 33 days, they were joined by a member of the Bhairavanathi
cooperative irrigation project.[3] The villagers also staged a protest at the
airport gate. They demanded information about airport operations including the
number of planes and helicopters using the facility since 2011 and whether
nearby hills would pose risks to aircraft safety if the expansion goes ahead.[4]
</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Already in 2011, Bharat Patankar, President of Shramik Mukti
Dal pointed out, that the expansion of the Karad Airport violates the national
resettlement and rehabilitation policy, which prohibits acquisition of
irrigated farmland. Karad Airport lies just 2 kilometers to the west of the
city of Karad. According to the Airport Authority of India, developments of
airports should be at least 15 km away from a city.[1]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Announcement of plans for Karad Airport expansion in 2011
triggered a major protest, on 6th July about 1,000 farmers = protested against
land acquisition, marching from the airport to the sub-divisional office (SDO)
where they submitted a memorandum and demanded a meeting with then Chief
Minister of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan, to discuss their grievances. The demonstrators
were accompanied by farmer leader Ashok Thorat who said: “No one from Karad has
ever demanded expansion of the airport. There are no industries in Karad, so commercial
air services were never introduced on this airport since inception.” He said
Karad Airport was only used “once in a while”, by ministers and other public representatives.[5]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In July 2012 The Hindu reported that more than 4,000 farmers
from the region were opposing Karad Airport expansion. Farmers warned of
agitation and Ashok Thorat said “the farmers are serious about not giving up
the land”.[6] In December 2012 Karad Airport expansion was raised in the
Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and a protest was held in front of the airport.[7]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Karad Airport also lies close to the Munde electricity
station in Karad, which is the main station of electricity transfer from the Koyna
hydroelectricity project. Affected villagers are concerned that tall
electricity towers surrounding the area of the planned expansion could be a
risk factor for aviation safety.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Affected villagers have also challenged the economic viability
of the airport expansion. A Government of Maharashtra report raised concerns
regarding commercial viability due to Karad Airport’s close proximity to the
existing Kolhapur Airport, a mere 70 kilometers away. Also, the Maharashtra Airport
Development Company, established by the Maharashtra state government to
construct several airports, proposed withdrawal of the Karad Airport expansion
project because of doubts over its commercial viability.[1]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">On 15<sup>th</sup> September 2019, after 50 days and nights,
farmers ended their sit-in protest again Karad Airport expansion. The farmers
maintain that the airport expansion project is illegal.[8]</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The state of California, USA has set high goals
to shift its energy system towards a more sustainable one based on renewable
energy (RE) resources. In 2015, it harvested more solar electricity than all
other 49 U.S.A. states combined. Before 2009, no solar projects were permitted
on public land in California. By 2015, there were already 29 solar project
permissions in the South-West of the U.S.A.. Developing large-scale solar
projects in the state of California has become increasingly challenging as new
federal regulations seek to decrease the environmental footprint and impact of
especially large-scale projects. On the other hand, the Obama administration
gave the development of renewable energy sources priority by pledging to
generate 20 gigawatt of power by 2020, which equals powering six million homes.

an example: another company called ‘<i>Ausra’</i> was before deluged by a union
group on environmental issues.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The Californian union group ‘California Union
for Reliable Energy’ even urged regulators to speed up the approval process in
case of the BSE project. The difference between BSE and <i>Ausra</i> is that
BSE had before pledged to hire labor-friendly contractors. The <i>Ausra</i>
company even accused labor unions to make abuse of environmental laws in order
to gain a labor agreement. Some developers contend that they are forced to sign
agreements pledging to utilize union labor, if they refuse “they can count on
the union group to demand costly environmental studies and deliver hostile
testimony at public hearings” </span><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US""><span style=""mso-no-proof:yes"">[11]</span></span><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">. Instead if they commit to make use
of union labor, they would not let the environmental objections materialize. Californian
energy commissioner Jeffrey Byron comments: <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>“this does stress the limits of credibility
[of the union’s environmental concerns] to some extent” </span><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US""><a name=""Bookmark45""><span style=""mso-no-proof:

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Californian <b>unionist lawyers negotiate</b>
both <b>labor agreements</b> and also participate in the <b>environmental
reviews</b> of the projects. The main question that arises from this fused
conflict of interests is if the future green sustainable energy system will be
based on a <b>service economy</b> with low-paid employees installing solar
technology or higher paid union labor. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Consequently, companies such as <i>Spinaker
Energy</i> and <i>Stirling Energy Systems </i>cannot enter a labor agreement on
a solar project in California. Some environmental groups being worried about
that these labor union tactics could cause a backlash in transitioning to a
renewable energy system. Others again, confirm that California’s unions show a
effectiveness at receiving extracting concessions that finally aid the environment.
<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Anyhow, the

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">In 2010, the project there was an amendment in

habitat of the imperiled desert tortoise that must be relocated and further
avoiding the disturbance of the area of rare plants. Initially, the project was
intended to take up 4,000 acres of land (1,619 ha). This number was shrunk by
12%, according to a <i>The New York Times </i>article </span><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US""><a name=""Bookmark48""><span style=""mso-no-proof:

contracting union labor (see above).</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The construction of the project was temporarily

getting into the light beams. A third measurement is the ‘nonlethal avian

sagarmatha-national-park-nepal,"National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act provides no recognition of indigenous people’s right to consultation or to access their traditional lands and resources. The authority to manage resource use ultimately lies in the hands of the national park warden, who grants the right of conditional use to local communities at his discretion. No mechanisms for co-management of park governance. Sherpa leaders are involved in promoting ICCA management. The Sherpa community and identity remains strong within the Khumbu region. Many traditional land use and resource management practices continue to this day and have at times even been encouraged by the government and park authorities. Areas of contention still exist, such as the recognition of Sherpa indigenous rights, and the ecological strain placed on the environment by unrestricted tourist growth.

For now there is no clear development plan for the reserves, and the Final Investment Decision has been pushed forward to 2023 [4].</span></p><br><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Suriname economy has been historically linked to extractive sectors.</span><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;""> Between the 17th and 19th century, the country's economy was initially focused on cocoa, sugar and cotton slave plantations under dutch colonial rule. In the 20th century, bauxite and aluminium became dominant sectors of the economy [5]. Currently, gold mining represents 75% of exports, with an important presence of artisanal small scale mining. Finally, the oil sector is becoming more important and now represents 10% of exports. Both the gold and oil sector are controlled through the national oil company Staatsolie which mostly developed onshore oil exploitations in Saramacca district until 2016. That year, after significant discoveries in the same oil basin in nearby Guyana, offshore exploration licences were put on tender to international oil companies, subject to participation rights for Staatsolie [6].</span></p><br><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span style=""font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Local environmental activist Erlan Sleur, chairman of Probios, opposes the extraction of offshore oil and advocates to keep the oil in the ground.

mbeubeuss-landfill-senegal,"<p></p><p><i>En Francais ci-dessous ---&nbsp;</i>The <b>issues</b> concerning Mbeubeuss landfill are <b>multiple</b> and complex to solve. Located 27km away from the capital, Mbeubeuss is a <b>mean</b><b>s</b><b> of subsistence</b> for one of the <b>poorest populations</b> in Dakar suburbs while the open-air landfill causes high <b>air</b><b> and soil c</b><b>ontamination</b> in the Malika District where more than 17,000 people live. The waste picker community is largely formed by young people unable to find a job. Mbeubeuss landfill represents their last chance to make a living. About <b>4,000 informal waste pickers</b> vigorously <b>defend</b><b> their source of reve</b><b>nue</b> even though it highly puts their health and lives at risk. They are a marginalized and discriminated group among the Senegalese society but they have organized in the <b>Bokk </b><b>D</b><b>iom</b><b> </b><b>Association</b> in the late 1990s when the government tried to remove them and later were granted formal recognition. Bokk Diom continues <b>fighting against their discrimination</b>, and for their recognition, cohesion, and <b>social rights</b>.</p><p>There has been an ongoing <b>discussion</b> about the closure of <b>Mbeubeuss </b><b>landfill</b> for many years. At stake is the <b>generation</b> of <b>private profits</b> from the management of waste. <b>Foreign</b> <b>investment</b> interests, mainly coordinated under the <b>World Bank programs,</b> have been proposing and influencing the Senegalese government. Already in 2005, a report from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (part of the World Bank) proposed the privatization of Mbeubeuss’ waste for the creation of a gas capture technology to generate electricity. The funds would have been provided through the UNFCCC’s Clean Development Mechanism but the project never materialized. By 2009, the closure of the Mbeubeuss landfill became conditionality for the <b>relocation</b> of the <b>3,000</b> <b>households</b> near Pikine, being displaced for the construction of a <b>highway between Dakar and Diamniadio</b>. The chosen relocation area was just two kilometers away from Mbeubeuss. The Senegalese government’s creditors (mainly the International Development Association, part of the World Bank Group) for the highway project were pressuring for the landfill closure. The World Bank was proposing to open a new site that would have only generated 300 jobs and where salaries would have been lower than the current earned revenues at Mbeubess.</p><p>The <b>waste pickers defende</b><b>d their self-employment</b> and mobilized through Bokk Diom and with the help of ENDA to oppose the project. As a result, the situation of the landfill remains still the same, open and managed by the informal waste pickers. Besides the World Bank and its associated programs, also other development agencies, such as the <b>Canadian</b><b> a</b><b>gency </b><b>I</b><b>DRC </b>advocated for the closure of Mbeubeuss for sanitarian and environmental reasons. The agency funded the project “Pure” from 2006 to 2011 during which it monitored the <b>social, health, and environmental impacts of the landfill on the living communities, the farmers and vegetable</b><b> growers</b> from Malika but also Diamalaye and Njagoo neighborhoods. These impacts should not be undermined, but the <b>waste pickers</b> <b>fight for</b> <b>bottom-up mitigation solutions</b> for the landfill impacts which takes into <b>consideration their</b> <b>perspectives and needs</b>, instead of a managerial, imposed perspective whose aim would be to foster private and foreign profits. They fiercely defend their source of livelihood. The involvement of international and foreign institutions is not necessarily going against the waste pickers’ will. For instance, <b>Bokk D</b><b>iom has set up a school for the children</b> of the dump<b> </b><b>with</b><b> fi</b><b>nancial help from European organizations</b> (French Agence Francaise du Developpement, the Luxembourg Agency for Development and the Belgian Ministry for Cooperation). The waste pickers also obtained funds from the United Nations Development Program to construct a <b>medical center</b> and the International Labor Organization has <b>trained youth</b> <b>fro</b><b>m the dump </b><b>in </b><b>o</b><b>ther professions</b> such as carpenter or baker. <b>Security issues</b> remain recurrent in the landfill and put at risk the lives of more than 400 waste pickers living inside the site.</p><p>The most recent tragedies happened in <b>December 201</b><b>6</b> when <b>a </b><b>m</b><b>assive </b><b>fire - the so-far largest ever recorded at the landfill - killed three peo</b><b>ple. </b>This also caused economic damage to the community as many waste pickers lost tons of recycled waste. Another fire happened in <b>March 2017</b>. After these tragedies, the public authorities committed to proposing a new study on the possibilities of the future of the landfill, expected by June 2017. In <b>February 2018, another massive fire broke out </b>at the Mbeubeuss landfill, destroying stored recycled waste, shelters, and most notably, the facilities of a small recycling business run by one of the founders of Bokk Diom, who started as a waste picker in the 1970s and now employed 75 people. This induced the association to stronger mobilize for on-site improvements at Mbeubeuss and also a crowdfunding campaign was started.</p><p>As of 2019/20, Mbeubeuss landfill is frequented by 4,000 waste pickers that are members of Bokk Diom and pay an annual union fee and even more who are not, and extends over an area of 175 hectares. The situation at the landfill was recently described by media as “out of control” and “an ecological and sanitary bomb”. While the waste picker community continues to face dangerous working conditions, insecurity, and a lack of social and health protection, also locals suffer from the adverse impacts of uncontrolled dumping. In December 2019, a group of nearby residents called ‘<b>Mbeubeuss Dafa Doy</b>’ (from the Malika, Yeumbeul Nord et Sud, Keur Massar, and Tivaouane Peul communities)<b> </b><b>staged protests </b>and criticized the misinformation by and inaction of public authorities, as the dump closure was already promised in 2012. The group demanded the relocation of the site and announced that, if necessary, they will proceed with the protests and block garbage trucks from entering the site.</p><p>In 2019, the organization <b>WIEGO </b>(Women in Informal Employment – Globalizing and Organizng)<b> </b>together with the the <b>ILO</b> launched a project to improve conditions for the waste pickers of Mbeubeuss and <b>strengthen their organizing in a cooperative</b>. The cooperation was started with a two-day workshop that brought together informal waste pickers, leaders of Bokk Diom, and several institutions involved in waste management. WIEGO, as part of its Focal Cities initiative, has been working with informal workers across the city and among others initiated a<b> project to improve the position of informal women waste pickers</b>, including elderly, who are unlikely to find formal employment. They provided training in cooperative management and the strengthening of women’s worker identity. It supported the <b>women’s cooperative ‘AVER-B’ </b>that brings together street vendors, domestic workers, waste pickers, and informal food manufacturers in marketing their products. Bokk Diom, which to 60 percent of women, now also has a <b>Women’s Recycling Committee </b>that aims to strengthen women’s rights at Mbeubeuss landfill.</p><p>Most recently, <b>new </b><b>plans to modernize,</b><b> rehabilitate and enclose </b><b>the Mbeubeuss landfill </b>were pushed forward by international institutions. In 2020, the Senegalese government received a new $US 125 loan from the International Development Association (IDA), a World Bank subsidiary, to modernize waste management in several cities. According to the plans, a <b>public-private partnership</b> should be established in Mbeubeuss to establish a waste treatment and disposal system in several phases. This would, first, include emergency measures to ensure safety at the site and prevent the entering of unauthorized persons. Later on, the site should become remodeled and optimized, including the installing of a leachate treatment system and a recycling center, in which former waste pickers would become employed.</p><p>The year<b> 2020 </b>brought the so far most visible mobilization of waste pickers in Dakar, as waste pickers of the Bokk Diom association held a <b>silent demonstration march on the Global Waste Pickers Day</b>, 1st of march, to commemorate the struggle of informal waste pickers around the globe. They also held a <b>press conference</b> in which they presented a memorandum with a <b>counter-proposal to the new Mbeubeuss landfill modernization project</b>. This, most notably, concerns a higher number of waste pickers to become part of the new landfill project and the creation of further opportunities to include waste pickers in municipal waste management.</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>En Francais</i> ---&nbsp;Les problèmes concernant la décharge de Mbeubeuss sont multiples et complexes à résoudre. Mbeubeuss est un moyen de subsistance pour les recycleurs informels, une des populations les plus pauvres de la banlieue de Dakar, alors que qu’en même temps la décharge en plein air provoque une forte contamination de l'air et du sol dans le district de Malika où vivent plus de 17 000 personnes. La communauté des recycleurs est constituée par des jeunes incapables de trouver un emploi à Dakar. Mbeubeuss se trouve à seulement 27 km de la capitale. La décharge représente leur dernière chance de gagner de quoi vivre. Les 4.000 recycleurs informels défendent vigoureusement leur source de revenus, même si celle-ci met leur santé et leur vie en danger. La communauté de recycleurs est marginalisée et discriminée dans la société sénégalaise. Elle s’est organisée avec la création du Bokk Diom à la fin des années 1990, lorsque le gouvernement a tenté de les évincer du site. Ils ont alors été formellement reconnus par le gouvernement. Bokk Diom continue de lutter contre leur discrimination, pour leur reconnaissance, leur cohésion et leurs droits sociaux. La discussion de la fermeture de Mbeubeuss se poursuit depuis plusieurs années. Les investissements étrangers, principalement coordonnés par des programmes dépendant de la Banque Mondiale, proposent et influencent le gouvernement sénégalais. Ce qui intéresse ces investissements ce sont les profits qui seraient générés par une gestion privée des déchets. Déjà en 2005, un rapport du Programme d'Aide à la Gestion du Secteur de l'Energie (membre de la Banque mondiale) a proposé la privatisation des déchets de Mbeubeuss pour la capture de gaz afin de produire de l'électricité. Les financements auraient été fournis par le Mécanisme de Développement Propre de la CCNUCC. Mais le projet ne s'est jamais concrétisé. En 2009, la fermeture de la décharge de Mbeubeuss était une condition pour la relocalisation des 3 000 ménages près de Pikine, déplacés pour la construction d'une autoroute entre Dakar et Diamniadio. En effet, la zone choisie pour la réinstallation de ces familles était à 2 kilomètres de la décharge. Les créanciers du gouvernement sénégalais (principalement l'Association Internationale de Développement, groupe membre de la Banque Mondiale) pour le projet routier pressaient la fermeture du site Mbeubeuss. En contrepartie, la Banque Mondiale proposait d'ouvrir un nouveau site qui n'aurait généré que 300 emplois et dont les salaires auraient été inférieurs aux revenus actuellement gagnés par les recycleurs. Bokk Diom s’est mobilisé, avec l'aide d'ENDA pour s'opposer au projet. Les recycleurs ont vigoureusement défendu leur travail indépendant. En conséquence, la situation de la décharge demeure la même, gérée par les récupérateurs de déchets informels. Outre la Banque Mondiale et ses programmes associés, d'autres agences de développement, comme l'agence canadienne CRDI / CRDI, plaident en faveur de la fermeture de Mbeubeuss pour des raisons sanitaires et environnementales. L'agence a financé le projet «Pure» de 2006 à 2011, au cours duquel elle a surveillé les impacts sociaux, sanitaires et environnementaux de la décharge sur les communautés avoisinantes, sur les élevages de porc et la production de légumes à Malika et dans les quartiers de Diamalaye et Njagoo. Ces impacts ne devraient pas être ignorés, mais les recycleurs se battent pour défender des solutions d'atténuation de ces impacts qui tiennent compte de leurs points de vue et de leurs besoins, contre une perspective imposée par le haut dont l'objectif serait avant tout de favoriser le profit d’acteurs privés et étrangers. L’implication des Institutions Internationales et étrangères ne va pas nécessairement contre la volonté des recycleurs, au contraire certains acteurs collaborent avec la communauté de Mbeubeuss. Par exemple, Bokk Diom a mis en place une école pour les enfants de la décharge grâce à l'aide financière des organisations européennes (Agence française de développement, Agence luxembourgeoise pour le développement et Ministère belge de la coopération). Les récupérateurs de déchets ont également obtenu des fonds de la part du Programme des Nations Unies pour le Développement afin de construire un centre médical et l'Organisation Internationale du Travail a formé les jeunes de la décharge à d'autres professions comme la boulangerie ou la menuiserie. Les problèmes de sécurité restent récurrents dans la décharge. Deux récentes tragédies ont eu lieu en décembre 2016 lorsqu'un incendie dans la décharge a tué trois personnes et en mars 2017 un autre incendie s'est produit. A la suite de ces tragédies, les autorités se sont engagées à proposer une nouvelle étude concernant l’avenir de Mbeubeuss. L’étude est&nbsp; attendue pour juin 2017.</p><p></p>",waste-management,Waste Management,#77721c,3,

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">En junio de 2014, ocurrió un hecho
inédito en México. El Tribunal Unitario Agrario número 28 con sede en la ciudad
de Hermosillo, capital del estado fronterizo de Sonora, falló a favor de la
demanda&nbsp;de 67 ejidatarias y ejidatarios de “El Bajío”, un ejido enclavado
en el desierto, totalmente en el municipio de Puerto Peñasco y alevosamente
registrado en el municipio de Caborca, bastión de la minera Penmont. La
sentencia judicial obliga a la minera Penmont, subsidiaria de&nbsp; Frsnillo
PLC del consorcio Industrias Peñoles, a devolver el oro extraído ilicitamente,
a restituir a cabalidad las condiciones ecológicas en las estaba el territorio
antes de la construcción ilegal de la mina a cielo abierto pues la minera
destruyó cerros, horadó la superficie y aniquiló flora y fauna. De no poder
hacer la restitución , deberá pagar&nbsp;el equivalente en dinero.&nbsp;</span></p>

Materias Penal y Administrativa del Quinto Circuito,&nbsp;ratificó el 28 de
Noviembre de 2014 el fallo del Tribunal Unitario Agrario 28 de Sonora. La&nbsp;
instancia judicial superior reconocía la propiedad social de la tierra,&nbsp;bajo
la forma ejidal, de la comunidad campesina e ilegitimaba el despojo de la
minera. Las y los ejidatarios habían demandado a uno de los tres consorcios
mineros más poderosos no solo de México sino de América Latina, encabezado por
el patriarca de la minería&nbsp;Alberto Bailléres González.&nbsp;</span></p>

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">Hasta este momento, el gigante minero
se encuentra en desacato, no cumplió con el fallo de las&nbsp; instancias
judiciales e inició una contraofensiva, centrada en la criminalización y la
persecución&nbsp;contra la comunidad ejidataria. El 12 de Octubre de 2014 ocho
ejidatarios fueron levantados por militares, les sembraron armas. Enviaron a
Pedro Francisco Santiago a un penal de alta seguridad en Tepic, Nayarit, acusándolo
de poseer una escopeta que le fue sembrada. El&nbsp; 3 de septiembre de 2017 fue
secuestrado por un comando armado el Presidente del comisariado ejidal, José de
Jesús Robledo Cruz. El 24 de octubre de 2017 fueron levantados, torturados
y&nbsp; amenazados 12 ejidatarios. El 12 de febrero de 2018 fueron asesinados
Nohemí Elizabeth López Gutiérrez y Raúl Ibarra de la Paz. El 29 de abril de
2021, José de Jesús Robledo Cruz y María de Jesús Gómez Vega fueron
acribillados. Ellas y ellos representaban&nbsp;a la comunidad ejidal y fueron
activas y activos defensores de la restitución de sus tierras.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">La resolución judicial contra el
poderoso consorcio Industrias Peñoles tocó dos pilares de la acumulación por
despojo (Roux, 2008) que se vive en el país desde hace tres décadas: las
ganancias ilimitadas&nbsp;a partir de la devastación ambiental y la impunidad
con la que ha operado.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

del desierto sonorense despliega diversos mecanismos de resistencia para
recuperar el territorio al que les robó la minera de la familia Bailléres y
hacer cumplir&nbsp;el fallo judicial. Las mujeres han jugado un papel
preponderante en el sostenimiento de la organización de la resistencia y han
mantenido la autonomía de la asamblea ejidal, máxima instancia de decisión del
núcleo agrario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">Las dimensiones del despojo
territorial de los consorcios mineros de los patriarcas
empresariales&nbsp;Carlos Slim Helú,&nbsp;Germán Larrea Mota-Velasco y Alberto
Bailléres González, que se convirtieron en los hombres más ricos de América
Latina,implican&nbsp;la&nbsp;posesión de poco más de&nbsp;3 millones de
hectáreas&nbsp;de territorio mexicano, similar&nbsp;al&nbsp;tamaño de estados
de la república como Puebla o Yucatán. El acaparamiento mediante el despojo a
los pueblos de sus tierras, les permite el saqueo de metales y la especulación
con la renta de la tierra, lo que explica que&nbsp;el&nbsp;70 por ciento, o
más, de los ingresos de sus conglomerados provenga de la
extracción&nbsp;minera.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">Industrias Peñoles tiene la concesión
de tierras más grande en México, casi 2 millones de hectáreas. Ocupa el 1er
lugar como productor de plata en México y es el principal exportador&nbsp;de
este metal. Su subsiduaria Fresnillo, Plc., se jacta de tener los costos de
producción más bajos en la curva de costos de la plata (Industrias Peñoles,
2014).&nbsp;Este&nbsp;es el poderoso consorcio minero que la comunidad ejidataria
sonorense ha enfrentado durante más de una década mediante movilizaciones y una
batalla jurídica que aún no concluye. El gran consorcio transnacional perdió
jurídicamente frente a una de las comunidades&nbsp;ejidales más pobres del
país. Las y los ejidatarios de El Bajío lograron&nbsp; sacar a la minera
Penmont de su territorio luego de una movilización en Palacio Nacional en 2020,
solicitando al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador que retirara a la fuerza
publica&nbsp;“Guardia Nacional” de sus tierras. La minera Penmont contó, antes
de este hecho, con el apoyo de las fuerzas de seguridad estatal y federal para
impedir que los ejidatarios&nbsp;&nbsp;recuperaran las 21,038 hectáreas
restituidas por el fallo agrario.&nbsp;</span></p>

hacer visible el conflicto que creó el consorcio Peñoles (Ver documental

Asamblea Ejidal acordó dedicar este territorio a la conservación de la unidad
ecológica del desierto de la que es parte el ejido El Bajío. A fin de buscar la
conservación de la flora y fauna ha solicitado certificar su territorio como
“Área Natural Protegida&nbsp;de manera Voluntaria”. Ésta, también, es una
medida para proteger el agua que se&nbsp;encuentran&nbsp;a más de 210 metros de
profundidad. También han emprendido la búsqueda de la desincorporación de
El&nbsp;Bajio&nbsp;al municipio de Caborca y pasar a formar parte del Municipio

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">En los últimos 10 años, aumentaron
significativamente los conflictos en América Latina y el Caribe entre los
consorcios mineros – “que conciben los territorios como espacios vacíos y
disponibles”&nbsp;(Téllez y Sánchez Salazar, 2018) y las comunidades que los
ocupan.&nbsp;&nbsp;El triunfo judicial de la comunidad campesina de El&nbsp;
Ejido El Bajío, en el noroeste de Sonora, puede convertirse en un caso
emblemático de la tensión entre la ofensiva de las megamineras y&nbsp;el
aparato estatal y la defensa del territorio, de una comunidad en particular,
que está en sintonía con decenas o cientos de comunidades en toda la región
latinoamericana.&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">En el caso de la comunidad ejidataria
de El Bajío, se evidencia lo que Maristella Svampa caracteriza
como&nbsp;la&nbsp;abierta conflictividad en los territorios extractivos, cuando
expresa que “(…) fueron numerosos los conflictos socioambientales y
territoriales que lograron salir del encapsulamiento local y adquirieron una
visibilidad nacional”. Explica asimismo que, a partir&nbsp;de 2010, las
comunidades indígenas y campesinas latinoamericanas lograron el reconocimiento
de sus derechos colectivos, territoriales y ambientales como parte de los cambios
jurídicos democráticos gubernamentales. En México, en 2011 se incorporó a la
Constitución&nbsp;nacional la perspectiva de los derechos humanos. Estos
avances en la “frontera de los derechos” (Svampa, 2019) puede ser una de las
razones que explican el fallo del Tribunal Unitario Agrario en 2014 a favor de
la comunidad ejidataria sonorense.&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">Por otro lado, algunos millonarios
como los Luksic de Chile o mexicanos como Slim, Bailléres y Larrea
Mota-Velasco&nbsp;<i>lograron</i>&nbsp;extender sus negocios
extractivistas&nbsp;a través de un proceso de despojo múltiple, en el que el
estado respaldó y promovió el proceso de monopolización de la tierra, al
otorgarles la concesión de los territorios para extraer minerales. Estos
personajes no habrían acumulado esa riqueza personal y&nbsp;empresarial
exorbitante sin el apoyo del aparato estatal que construyó el andamiaje legal
para impulsar y reconfigurar dicha acumulación de capital. Entonces, en el
curso de tres décadas, en la región se configuraron dos tendencias jurídicas
contradictorias:&nbsp;las reformas jurídico estructurales que crearon leyes que
protegen y validan la acumulación por despojo de los consorcios
transnacionalizados y, en contraste, el paradigma de los derechos humanos y las
legislaciones garantistas que validan los derechos colectivos,&nbsp;culturales
y territoriales de los pueblos indígenas y campesinos (Peláez, 2015). Esta es
la disputa por los bienes comunes en América Latina y el
Caribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

color:black;mso-fareast-language:ES-TRAD"">No obstante la imbricación entre
estas burguesías de la región y diversos dispositivos legales y policiales para
garantizar su acumulación incesante de ganancias en el sector minero,&nbsp;a
través de los mecanismos de la acumulación por despojo, la resistencia de las
comunidades campesinas e indígenas o la oposición comunitaria como las de Conga
y Tía María en Perú, actualmente suspendidas, al igual que Pascua Lama en
Argentina, los efectos&nbsp;del derrame de la minera Vale en Brasil y los
crecientes movimientos de resistencia en diversas regiones de México, definen
la dinámica de conflictividad socio ambiental y territorial en toda la
región.&nbsp;</span></p>

raffineria-di-roma-italy,"<p>La Raffineria di Roma nasce per opera dei conti Miani nei primi anni 
‘50 nei pressi di Trastevere. Nel 1965 viene rilevata dalla Total Fina 
Italia S.p.A. e spostata nell'attuale sede di Ponte Galeria, a ovest di 
Roma, tra l’Aurelia, il Grande Raccordo Anulare e la Roma Civitavecchia 
[1].</p><p>Quest’area, Malagrotta, è soggetta ad una forte pressione 
ambientale, infatti, nel raggio di 50 km² sono presenti anche la nota 
discarica di rifiuti urbani, un inceneritore di rifiuti ospedalieri e 
farmaci scaduti dotato di un sistema per il recupero energetico 
(termovalizzatore), depositi di idrocarburi e cave per inerti [2]. La 
raffineria è stata per molti anni l’unico polo di lavorazione e 
distribuzione di prodotti petroliferi dell’Italia centrale.</p><p>Fino 
al 2010 la quota di maggioranza della raffineria era di proprietà della 
Total Fina [3]. A seguito della joint venture tra Total e Erg, la 
nascente TotalErg diviene proprietaria al cento per cento dell'impianto 
[4]. Alla fine del 2012, viste le difficoltà del settore, la TotalErg 
decide di cessare l'attività di raffinazione mantenendo in funzione 
solamente il polo logistico per lo stoccaggio e la distribuzione di 
carburanti già lavorati [5].</p><p>Decisione presa anche a causa della 
forte concorrenza che le società asiatiche e mediorientali esercitano 
nel settore petrolifero. Infatti, grazie al minor costo dell'energia, a 
una legislazione più permissiva per quanto riguarda le normative 
ambientali, ai vantaggi fiscali di cui spesso queste società possono 
godere e anche a un costo del lavoro nettamente più basso, il mercato 
viene inondato dal petrolio di queste zone, facendo diventare 
sconveniente la produzione di idrocarburi in Italia, come nel resto 
d'Europa [6].</p><p>A partire da questa situazione e visto l'andamento 
altalenante dei mercati, l'Unione Petrolifera stimava, nella primavera 
del 2012, che in Italia fossero a rischio oltre 7500 posti di lavoro, 
considerando che ogni raffineria, indotto compreso, occupava in media 
1500 persone [7].</p><p>Quanto questa stima fosse realistica, lo ha 
dimostrato il fatto che, oltre alla struttura romana, negli ultimi anni 
sono stati chiusi anche gli impianti di Falconara, di proprietà 
dell'Api, e quello di Gela, di proprietà dell'ENI [5].</p><p>Nel caso 
specifico della Raffineria di Roma, a partire dal giugno del 2012 si 
sono susseguite varie iniziative e manifestazioni di protesta da parte 
dei lavoratori nei confronti dell'azienda per evitare licenziamenti di 
massa. La TotalErg S.p.A., però, non aveva presentato tempestivamente un
 vero e proprio piano occupazionale, pur avendo annunciato la 
trasformazione della raffineria in un polo logistico per lo stoccaggio, e
 quindi alla fine dello stesso anno centinaia di persone si ritrovarono 
senza lavoro [7][8].</p><p>Nel contempo, all'interno del dibattito 
pubblico, si è ricominciato a parlare anche della pericolosità del sito 
contro il quale, per lungo tempo, gli ambientalisti e i movimenti civici
 avevano dato battaglia. Per anni, infatti, le ciminiere, a due passi 
dalla discarica di Roma, sono state il simbolo dell'aspetto più 
distruttivo di un modello di sviluppo altamente impattante sia per 
l’ambiente che per la salute [7].</p><p>È per questo motivo che a 
partire dagli anni ’90 furono incoraggiati diversi studi epidemiologici –
 che tuttora continuano ad essere effettuati con cadenza periodica – 
vista la presenza nella stessa area di diversi impianti industriali e il
 conseguente aumento della preoccupazione dei residenti riguardo i 
possibili rischi per la loro salute. I risultati delle indagini (i più 
recenti sono datati aprile 2013) hanno dimostrato che ci sono stati 
eccessi di mortalità per varie tipologie tumorali – tra le quali 
spiccano quelle ai polmoni e alla vescica oltre che decessi causati da 
tumori celebrali e mieloma multiplo – tra i lavoratori della raffineria 
che si sono succeduti negli anni [2]. Dagli stessi studi epidemiologici 
non è, invece, emersa una diretta correlazione tra l'aumento di malattie
 tumorali tra la popolazione che vive nelle vicinanze della raffineria e
 la raffineria stessa [2].</p><p>In tempi più recenti, la Raffineria di 
Roma è tornata alla ribalta delle cronache per dei furti di gasolio 
avvenuti nel febbraio del 2015, in cui sono stati forati i tubi della 
condotta dell'impianto, procurando un'enorme perdita di carburante 
(oltre 5mila litri) nel canale delle Vignole e nel terreno adiacente 
alla zona della raffineria, compromettendo irreparabilmente l'ecosistema
 ambientale dell'intera area [9].</p><p>A seguito di questo avvenimento,
 la Prefettura di Roma, con Decreto prot. n. 185764 del 2 luglio 2015, 
ha approvato il Piano di Emergenza Esterna (PEE) per la Raffineria di 
Roma visti i rilevanti rischi di incidente [10].</p><p>Nonostante il 
conflitto, almeno dal punto di vista della produzione, sembrava essere 
chiuso, nell'Agosto del 2017 una novità ha riacceso l'allarme sulla 
raffineria. Il primo Agosto 2017 infatti è stata avvitata la procedura 
di verifica di assoggetabilità ambientale presentata dalla raffineria di
 Roma S.p.A. per le modifiche impiantistiche presso il deposito di 
Pantano di Grano per l’implementazione di un sistema di ricezione, 
stoccaggio ed esportazione del greggio estratto dai giacimenti Tempa 
Rossa. Nello specifico ""il progetto prevede la possibilità di garantire 
il transito settimanale di circa 22.950 m3</p><p>di grezzo provenienti 
dal centro trattamento olii di Corleto di Perticara in Basilicata. Il 
trasferimento del grezzo avverrà tramite autobotti e isocontainers, per 
un numero stimato massimo giornaliero di 170 mezzi aventi capacità di 30
 m3, che saranno caricati fino ad</p><p>un massimo di 27 m3. Dal Deposito di Pantano di</p><p>Grano,
 il grezzo sarà quindi inviato, attraverso il reparto costiero di 
Fiumicino su nave a mezzo delle infrastrutture esistenti [11][12]. </p><p></p>",fossil-fuels-and-climate-justice-energy,Fossil Fuels and Climate Justice/Energy,#111,5,

uranium-mining-in-kakadu-national-park-australia,"<p></p><p>There are three operating uranium mines in Australia -Ranger in Kakadu National Park in Northern Territory; Olympic Dam in South Australia; and Beverley with Four Mile in South Australia.&nbsp; Ranger is situated within the perimeter of the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park (Kakadu).&nbsp; Kakadu has two other rich uranium deposits yet to be developed - Jabiluka and Koongarra.</p><p>Ranger was developed against the wishes of local traditional owners - the Mirrar people.&nbsp; Senior Traditional Owner Toby Gangale, opposed plans for uranium exploration and mining on his country in the 1970s.&nbsp; His opposition, along with that of other local Aboriginal people, was overruled by the Federal Government when it legislated for the development of the Ranger Uranium Mine in 1976.&nbsp; Ranger commenced operations in 1980, the mine is now run by Energy Resources Australia (ERA) which is majority owned by Rio Tinto.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the early 1980s, yellowcake from Mirarr land has been sent to fuel nuclear reactors in Japan, Europe and elsewhere. By 2019 Ranger uranium mine is now coming to the end of its life. Mining has concluded and minimal processing of stockpiled ore continues as the company contemplates the enormous rehabilitation task.</p><p>ERA announced the closure and rehabilitation of the entire site by 2021.&nbsp; In December 2014 ERA called for public comment on its environmental impact statement for a massive new ‘Ranger 3 Deeps’ underground mine. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF, Sweeney 2014) responded that the proposed mining technique was untested in monsoonal tropical areas and risked the rehabilitation of the site.&nbsp; ACF cited the 200+ leaks, spills, accidents and license breaches at Ranger Uranium Mine to date and the negative impacts on local (Indigenous) communities living downstream as well as the environmentally and culturally significance of the environment: ‘It is home to the world's richest breeding grounds for migratory tropical water birds, majestic waterfalls, vast wetlands teeming with wildlife, Indigenous rock art sites and over 50,000 years of living tradition and cultural practice’.</p><p>After the Fukushima accident, the traditional landowners were worried also by the impact of the activity on their land has on others. The possibility of uranium from Mirarr land being incorporated into a nuclear weapon or present at the site of a nuclear accident is therefore of enormous concern to Mirarr. Despite assurances from successive Federal Governments that Australian uranium is only sold for&nbsp;nuclear power, the fact remains that is impossible to guarantee&nbsp;Australian uranium does not end up in nuclear weapons. In April 2011, following the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster in Japan,&nbsp;Yvonne Margarula wrote to UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon&nbsp;and expressed her sorrow at the impacts radiation is having on the lives of Japanese people. She noted that, ‘it is likely that the radiation problems at Fukushima are, at least in part, fuelled by uranium derived from our traditional lands. This makes us feel very sad.’&nbsp; (1).</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1.75rem; margin-top: 0px; color: rgb(33, 36, 56); font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; font-size: 18.75px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"">Leaving aside the damage that the extracted uranium has done elsewhere, the local rehabilitation costs amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.&nbsp; After the price collapse following the Fukushima nuclear crisis, times in the uranium trade were difficult.

detencion-arbitraria-y-golpes-en-contra-de-11-integrantes-de-la-comunidad-escolastica-defensores-del-territorio-por-parte-de-la-secretaria-de-seguridad-ciudadana-del-estado-de-queretaro,"<p></p><p>El 13 de junio de 2023, la comunidad de Escolásticas, Pedro Escobedo en Querétaro, vivió una confrontación entre pobladores y tres agencias policiales (dos municipales y una estatal) que derivó en once personas detenidas [1]. Esto ocurrió mientras pobladores, con presencia importante de mujeres y niños, se manifestaban por la aprehensión contra tres personas por el presunto delito despojo de un predio en la localidad de El Sabino [2]. </p><p>La Fiscalía argumentó una detención legal mientras los pobladores señalaron el uso indebido del aparato penal para favorecer a un particular [3]. El origen del conflicto es la definición de propiedad de un predio en cuyo interior se encuentran manantiales de competencia federal y árboles sabinos milenarios, un área de importante valor ecológico [4]. Las hectáreas se encuentran en disputa legal [5] entre la propiedad comunal datada de 1936 y una serie de compra ventas privadas señaladas como irregulares por no contar con la autorización de la asamblea ejidal.&nbsp;La disputa tiene precedentes de conflictos, incluyendo amenazas y agresiones por parte de distintos particulares hacia la comunidad ejidal en 1936, 1968, 1973 y 1996. Quien se ostenta como el más reciente propietario es quien interpuso la denuncia penal motivo de las detenciones. Investigaciones periodísticas revelaron que mantiene una estrecha relación de favorecimiento indebido con el gobierno local [6].</p><p>Grupos ambientalistas como Vocer@s de la Madre Tierra han acompañado a la comunidad de Escolásticas en la protección y defensa de su tierra común. En abril de 2023 realizaron señalamientos sobre la construcción de un muro cercando el área de manantiales conocida como ""Los Sabinos"" y&nbsp; la alteración de árboles endémicos, los cuales califican como susceptibles de protección federal por su valor como patrimonio natural y seguridad hídrica. También detectaron venta privada de pipas de agua proveniente de los manatiales comunitarios [7].</p><p>Durante el operativo, las 11 personas detenidas, entre ellas un menor de 17 años, sufrieron fuertes lesiones, permanecieron temporalmente desaparecidas y fueron localizadas en centros penitenciarios solo después de la intervención judicial. La Defensoría de los Derechos Humanos de Querétaro (DDHQ), ante quien se interpuso queja formal, no inició queja de oficio ni medidas cautelares pese a que su personal estuvo en el lugar de los hechos [8].</p><p>Luego de que redes nacionales, actores internacionales y organizaciones locales emitieron pronunciamientos, además de la presión social y recursos de amparo, el 20 de junio, 9 personas fueron liberadas bajo amenaza y aún en condición de penalmente acusadas [9].</p><p>Igual que en otros casos de defensa del territorio, en Escolásticas se reportó estigmatización de la protesta por parte de las autoridades [10] intimidación a las personas defensoras [11] y criminalización. Este es el tercer caso de represión a la defensa del agua en el estado de Querétaro en 2022 y 2023 [12].</p><p></p>",water-management,Water Management,#00bdff,6,

milieudefensie-suits-the-royal-dutch-shell-for-failing-to-play-its-part-in-the-fight-against-climate-change,"<p></p><p>The case is about the environmental group Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth suing the Royal Dutch Shell for failing to play its part in the fight against climate change and thereby breaching its duty of care under Dutch law and human rights obligations.</p><p>Established in 1971, Milieudefensie is the Netherland’s most influential climate organization. Since 1972, it has been a member of Friends of the Earth International, the largest grassroots environmental network on an international level [1]. Shell, previously known as Royal Dutch Shell [2], is an Anglo-Dutch multinational and one of the largest oil and gas companies worldwide and in consequence one of the biggest corporate producers of greenhouse gases [3].</p><p>In 2019, Mileudefensie together with other NGOs and the signatures of more than 17.000 citizens, started a lawsuit against Shell arguing that Shell has an obligation to contribute to the prevention of climate change on basis of the duty of care under the unwritten standard of the Dutch Civil Code, Book 6 Section 162 and the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. In line with these legal foundations, they demanded that Shell reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030 - compared to the 2019 level - and use its great influence to provide consumers with more sustainable choices. According to Milieudefensie, Shell had known the dangerous effects of the company’s emissions for decades and failed to take appropriate action up to the present time [4].</p><p>Shell defended itself by giving mainly two arguments: First, they argued that cutting out further emissions would not have any effect because those emissions would be replaced by other companies due to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Second, Shell argued that there was no legal basis for the company to be sued for its emissions and that the plaintiff’s arguments were too general in order to fall within the scope of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) [5].</p><p>On May 26 in 2021, The Hague District Court ruled that Shell had to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030 across emissions from its own operations and effects of the company’s produced oil. According to the court, this decision was made on the basis of the duty of care under the unwritten standard of the Dutch Civil Code and the Paris climate goals [6]. <br></p><p>As of today, Shell has not taken any action to further reduce its emissions in line with the court's decision. It should also be mentioned that the company moved their headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK, even though the company denies any relation of the relocation to the court’s judgment but explains it mainly with the 15% dividend tax that the Dutch government puts on big multinationals [7]. In April 2022, Milieudefensie sent a letter to the company's board of directors asking for urgent action. Shell, for its part, appealed against the court's decision in June 2022, and it remains to be seen what the outcome of this conflict will be [5]. However, it raises the broader question of whether private companies can be held responsible for taking appropriate action on climate change and liable for failing to do so.</p><p></p>",fossil-fuels-and-climate-justice-energy,Fossil Fuels and Climate Justice/Energy,#111,5,

the site’s clean-up once the project is retiring as well as to keep distance in
form of a ‘350-foot setback from adjacent properties’. The recommended denial had
over 500 votes against the project and was comprised mostly of people opposing
the project. The final consensus finally synthesized in the size of the project
being too big or ambitious. This is underlined by the fact that officials voted
for the recommendation of <b>other</b> project approvals with the scope of a

vincis-plan-for-a-new-airport-mid-nature-reserve,"Airport
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">On January 8<sup>th</sup>
2019, the portuguese government signed an agreement with VINCI (now
full shareholder of ANA – Autoridade Nacional to significantly
increase air traffic capacity in the two  main Portuguese cities of
Lisbon and Porto. The deal includes:</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">An expansion of the
Portela Airport infrastructure in Lisbon which would increase
possible air traffic by about 50%</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">An expansion of the
Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport (Porto) which would lead to similar
increase by about 60%</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">The building of an
entirely new commercial airport in Montijo (southern bank of the
Tejo) on top of the currently existing Air Force Base nº 6. This
would also include the creation of new highway accesses to the
airport and Vasco da Gama bridge (also owned by Vinci).</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Not only would this
lead to an enormous increase in air-traffic related CO2 emissions -
the likes of which would make air-traffic the single largest cause of
atmospheric polution in the country – but the selected area is also
one of the largest remaining wetland ecosystems in Europe, and a
natural wildlife reserve crucial for dozens of bird species to feed
in. The impact on local bird populations would be disastrous, to say
nothing of the risk it constitutes for passenger safety to have birds
flying at low altitudes near jet turbines.<br>As if this decision in
itself wasn't bad enough, the conditions under which this deal was
signed are in blantant disregard for EU laws pertaining to the need to
perform an environmentl impact study prior to the construction of
these projects. The preliminary study was completed in late July, and
as we expected, it's findings are confusing to say the least: It
warns of grave environmental and safety risks, but says the location
is viable. The project is now in a period of public consultation
until the 19<sup>th</sup> of September, though participation by the
population has been predictably low; We also believe the choice of
this period is not an accident either, as August and September are
the months in which most of the population is on holidays and is less
likely to notice or protest this governmental decision, which is
plainly detrimental to public and ecological health and serves the
capitalistic interests of those who would truly profit with this
deal:the multinational corporation VINCI and certain members within the
Portuguese political class.</p><p></p>",infrastructure-and-built-environment,Infrastructure and Built Environment,#999,7,

supply in the metropolitan area of Barcelona is historically owned and
organized by private, powerful actors (except for the civil war period 1936-1939).
A brief history overview shows the involvement of such entities: </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
115%;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">The <i>Sociedad
General de Aguas de Barcelona </i>(SGAB) was established in the early 1920s due
to the purchase by a conglomerate by Spanish banks. SGAB is now owned by <i>AGBAR</i>
(<i>Aguas de Barcelona</i>) group which was created 1975. In 1979, <i>Lyonnaise
des Eaux </i>(later transformed into water multinational Suez)<i> </i>became a
main shareholder of the entity, now being the sole owner by buying all stocks
in 2015 [1]. Because the contracting conditions remained obscure throughout
many decades, in 2010, a judge ruled the situation of the company and its
activities to be illegal, forcing <i>AGBAR</i> and the Barcelona Metropolitan
Area (<i>AMB</i>) to sign a public-private partnership (PPP) contract in order
to regularise the situation [7]. 2012, a mixed-capital company was established (85%
private capital: <i>SGAB</i> holds 70% and another <span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">15% belong to holding group <i>Criteria,
</i>part of the banc <i>La Caixa </i>[19]</span></span><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">)</span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">
meanwhile <i>AMB</i> holds only 15%). <i>Aigües de Barcelona </i>now manages
and controls up to 93% of the urban water supply in the 23 municipalities and
thus 9 out of 10 customers depend on water supply by the <i>AGBAR</i> group. [1]

Barcelona is filled with unnecessary or illegitimate costs which are not

estimates revealed that <i>AGBARs</i> water rates are more expensive than in
neighbouring towns with public management such as El Prat de Llobregat and
Barbera. As a result, a part of the costs is financed at the expense of
consumers through taxes included in the water bills. <span class=""etext"">This
part of the bill represents approximately 3% of mean family budgets and
eventually build a greater proportion of the bill than the service itself. This
development can affect lower income households of the central city and
surrounding towns relatively more [2]. </span>In the Spanish context this is a
severe condition since 17% of the population suffer from energy poverty,
meaning frequent difficulties of paying their electricity, gas or water bill
[8]. In Barcelona over 120,000 people have been found to be suffering from this
specific kind of poverty related to access to water. These cases of water cut-offs
mostly occur where water services are privately managed: 75% of municipalities
with private services cut off water supplies for unpaid bills, whereas in the
municipalities where the service is public that proportion falls to only 8%
[25].</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">Civil
society activists in Barcelona close to the NGO <i>Enginyeria sense Fronteres (Engineers
without Borders)</i> and the <i>Federation of Neighbourhood Associations of
Barcelona (FAVB)</i> <span style=""color:black;mso-themecolor:text1"">are </span>challenging
this private management and fight for public water in Barcelona. Therefore,
they <span style=""color:black;mso-themecolor:text1"">established the Plataforma <i>Aigua
es Vida</i> in 2011 (Water is life platform) [11]. The platform was built by a
wide variety of civil society organisations: neighbourhood associations, trade
unions, environmental and international solidarity organisations. Its aim is to
advocate for the public sector to decide on water policy and control the entire
water cycle in Barcelona and all of Catalonia, including civil society
participation and oversight to ensure the quality of the service and democratic
governance. The platform is actively campaigning against the role of the
private sector in the management of water and sanitation and especially the
monopoly position that <i>AGBAR</i> holds [10]. </span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
115%;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">The 35-year
integral water cycle concession for greater Barcelona to the largest private
operator without an open tender is facing concerted opposition from competing
private sector water operators (<i>Aguas de Valencia</i>) as well as NGOs and
associations. Critics are based on the lack of transparency, missing auditing
by external actors of asset distributions as well as the precarious legal
position of the operations themselves [3]. In March 2016, a judgment of the Court
of Justice of Catalonia (TSJC) cancelled the public-private partnership
contract for water supply to 23 municipalities in the Metropolitan Area of
Barcelona, arguing that there is neither a legal base, economic reasoning or
technical base for the companies activities [15]. <i>AGBAR</i> has filed an
appeal with the Supreme Court of Spain to override the ruling [7]. Continuously,
the court ruling by the TSJC passed to the Supreme Court of Spain, which has
the obligation of reaching a final verdict for the case [9].</span></p>

result of years of citizen movement campaigning for access to basic rights and
against the corruption of traditional political parties the election in 2015
brought the political group <i>Barcelona en Comú</i> into Barcelonas City Council
[7]. The group incorporated among leftist parties such as Podemos (resulting
partly from the anti-austerity movement), also parts of the above-mentioned
civil campaigns and implemented remunicipalisation demands into their agenda.
Said agenda specifically aims to establish democratic and transparent
assessment, debate and decision structures regarding preferred public interest
while also involving workers unions [4]. </span></p>

contestation by <i>Barcelona En Comu</i> started with a motion in 2016 to analyse
and concentrate on direct public management of the water cycle. Subsequently,
most leftist groups of the Barcelona City Council voted in favour [14]. This
process can be seen as an important step forward towards establishing an agenda
to remunicipalise water services in the metropolitan area. <i>AGBAR</i> took a
counter position to the plan and decided not to co-operate and did not provided
any corporate or technical information. [7] </span></p>

color:black;mso-themecolor:text1"" lang=""EN-GB"">In 2018 more than 200 citizen organisations
initiated the Public and Democratic Water Movement to guarantee public,
democratic water management in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona [23]. The
Movement soon started a petition and collected more than 25,000 signatures
showing a more than sufficient number of voices supporting a referendum on
water management in Barcelona. The petition proposed the following question to
citizens: ""Do you wish water management in Barcelona to be public and with
citizen participation?"". <i>AGBAR</i> started several legal and
administrative appeals and leveraged all its connections in the economic and
political establishments to prevent the referendum from taking place [6]. Also,
the company launched a huge marketing operation including advertising space on local
TV, radio and billboards and sponsoring community initiatives in order to
improve its image [8]. Initially, the local law allowing such public
consultations fell short of the necessary support in the plenary session held
by the Barcelona Council in April 2018. Effectively this was due to formal
issues regarding the nature of the motion <i>Barcelona en Comu </i>started not
of the content itself [12]. However, the local referendum on remunicipalisation
of water was postponed to the next electoral cycle [6]. Despite losing
percentage points, <i>Barcelona en Comu</i> managed to win the 2019 election
and built a government with the </span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"" lang=""EN-GB"">Socialists' Party of Catalonia
[24] which brings new opportunities to focus on remunicipalisation in the
following years.</span></p>

system would mean a compensation in case of a potential remunicipalisation.
Following the highest Spanish court, the TSCJ cannot be seen as a legal base
for expropriation but does also not exclude this option. In Summary, it can
serve as a basis for the application of the preceptors of exception (to the
publicity of the procedure of awarding and free competition) [15]</span></p>

out against national lobby groups of powerful water companies and demand the Spanish
state and government officials via the <i>Red Agua Pública (RAP)</i> to
