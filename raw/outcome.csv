Daniel Kammen, Professor at the University of California in Berkeley and former World Bank 'Clean Energy Czar”, has shown (pdf attached) that Kosovo has renewable energy capacities that could deliver 34 percent of energy demand by 2025, while providing over 60 percent more jobs than a business as usual path, with estimated cost savings of 5-50% relative to a scenario that includes a new coal power plant. If energy efficiency programmes are put in place, losses are curbed, renewable energy is developed, and the existing Kosovo B plant is rehabilitated, the study finds, there is no need for a costly new plant.",,"The project currently does not proceed, but there is no guarantee that it will be finally stopped.

"The Barh Mukti Abhiyan has been at the forefront of constructive and robust critique of ‘hard engineering solutions’ in favour of soft flood control strategies based on local channel diversions and drainage network systems for containing and routing flood water through agricultural areas and wetlands. The Abhiyan’s foundation is based on a belief that the local communities would be self-reliant and achieve better control of floods than what is even possible by current embankment and dam operations [5,10]. The embankments provide a false sense of security to people, but instead can worsen floods by not allowing releases of water (in fact, embankments have been broken down by people in some cases to allow flood waters to find their way) [7,10]. The problem of flood risk for lakhs of people trapped between embankments needs urgent resolution by identifying solutions for better resettlement of affected families. Currently, displaced settlements regularly have to move around, with an interval of about 3 years at any given site. This lack of livelihood security has also led to cases of violent conflict between displaced refugees and settled village populations in the countryside. 
Hydrologists have also identified the better management of barrage operations in order to provide ecological flow regimes in the river channel through the dry season, at a steady flow rate. It is argued that the current modified extremes will reduce the intensity with which barrages are compelled to release waters (in a burst, typically) at the onset of the monsoonal flooding season. Managing releases from barrages based on ecological flow (e-flow) regime guidelines would also temper down the ultimate impact of immediate alarm situations that often occur due to extreme rainfall in the Himalayan catchments or with breaches of upstream embankments [28]. E-flow maintainance also involves allocating and using irrigation water with greater efficiency and productive output, improving communication across different sectors demanding water, and decentralized management of canal and groundwater irrigation systems. These solutions are more at a systemic level but their flood management implications are critical. 
More proximate solutions include providing aid packages to displaced as well as embankment-trapped villages, better alarm systems (e.g. Flood Management Information System-Bihar), and improved disaster response both on part of the state and civil society. ",Local political strife ,"Several settlements still continue to remain trapped within embankments, and face conflicts from not only the state structures of water management / control, but also local power structures strongly based on caste and class divides, and conflicts that result from entrenched paradigms of water control continue over agriculture, ownership of and access to land and water, and fisheries / aquatic cropping systems. Baghel (2014) accurately points out that despite wide acknowledgment of these problems and risks, governments continue to wholly depend on the same flood control approaches, citing immediacy and the need for more engineering to mend the failures of current engineering. Underlying this rigidity are many factors, right from a rationality that remains persistent despite its chequered but long history, the drive for control of landscape boundaries and revenue, and political strategies and corruption that is based on maintaining risk in societies for continued reproduction of power structures and control.",Not sure,In operation,environmental-injustice-and-social-vulnerability-due-to-dams-embankments-and-bank-erosion-in-the-ganga-kosi-floodplains-of-bihar-india,5.0,#ee2c2c,

"Joint statement by forest experts about the need to stop Irresponsible Development of Est-For Pulp Mill
Elbiku, Estonia (3).  25 April 2018
We call on the Estonian government to stop the environmentally and socially dangerous Est-For mill project. We are particularly concerned that:
The mill would consume around 3.3 million cubic metres of wood, more than a quarter of the total national timber production, yet Estonian forests are already exploited beyond their capacity for natural regeneration.
The mill would consume 1.2% of the Emajõgi river flow and then release this as effluent.
The citizens of Tartu and their representatives have clearly stated they do not want a mill of this size due to the impact on their region.
We are dismayed to discover that the Estonian government has turned a deaf ear to the plea from the City Council of Tartu and its citizens to stop the planning process.
Estonian forests have a priceless value for the country’s citizens, for biodiversity and for the global climate. They deserve to be protected from intensive extraction of wood for paper, timber and biomass.
Protecting the Estonian forests would be the best way to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Estonia’s independence and democratic governance.

Farmers agitating against land acquisition for the Govindpura (Mansa) thermal plant in Punjab have suspended their agitation till September 13, 2011 after talks between them and Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Badal has assured the agitating farmers that he will initiate the process to return the land to the owners [6]",,"With the acquisition of this land, 62 families of the village have become landless. Another 123 families have been left with very small holdings.
Besides the farmers, families of 14 Dalit agricultural laborers have also been devastated. The houses in which they were living for the last many decades have been acquired by the Govt for this project, rendering them homeless. No compensation has been paid to them on the excuse that the land on which these houses were constructed was not in their name.
Total compensation package ranging from Rs. 23.23 lakhs to Rs.23.77 lakh per acre, including displacement allowances and no litigation incentive etc has been announced, which is very meager. The Govt is paying Rs. 23.77 lakhs per acre for 80 acres, Rs.23.54 lakhs for 560 acres and Rs. 23.23 lakhs for 166 acres to the landowners. 
There is no provision for providing employment to the project affected families in the Rehabilitation Policy. In fact the Govt has not announced any Relief & Rehabilitation policy for these people. As already mentioned a considerable section of agriculturists families of the village (about 185) have turned landless or marginal farmers after the acquisition of their lands. They are not able to buy lands in adjoining villages at the rates on which their own lands have been acquired. So they are bound to suffer displacement & loss of livelihood.
About 40 percent of population of the village belongs to Scheduled Caste & Backward Classes. They were mainly dependent upon agricultural labor and allied professions for their livelihood. With the area under cultivation shrinking from 1458 acres to 652 acres, they will also loose livelihood and shall be forced to migrate to other places.
Fourteen families of poor agricultural laborers have lost their houses, without getting any compensation or relief. 
There have been corruption & nepotism in awarding this power project, without calling open tenders, to a little known Poena Power Company, a subsidiary of Indiabulls Infrastructure, having very little or no experience in power sector.

"International aid organizations: Open Society Foundations and European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) have been confronted with an abundance of challenges in attempting to move the Roma away from the toxic campsites. Many Roma lack the birth certificates and citizenship documents necessary to obtain jobs, housing permits, and permission to move freely outside of the camps [3]. A criminal complaint filed with the Kosovo prosecutor in September 2005 against unknown perpetrators alleging criminal neglect resulting in prolonged exposure to a highly toxic environment did not result in an investigation [7]. A complaint filed by the international NGO the European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) in February 2006 with the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of Roma IDPs was ruled inadmissible on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over UNMIK-administered Kosovo [7]. The ERRC then started a campaign following a damning report published by the Human Rights Advisory Panel in 2016. This panel called on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to publicly acknowledge its abject failure to comply with applicable human rights standards and apologise to Roma placed in lead contaminated camps, and to compensate victims for material and moral damage [4]. In 2016, the Human Rights Advisory Panel (HRAP) of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) released an opinion on the case [11]. The opinion concluded that numerous articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child were violated by UNMIK. Among the human rights identified by the Advisory Panel as being violated were the rights to life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, health, respect for private and family life, an adequate standard of living, and suffered discrimination. Numerous violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child were identified, including exploitation. The HRAP found that for many years, UNMIK failed to make sufficient efforts to relocate the displaced families despite awareness of serious risk to the internally displaced community’s health and wellbeing from the toxic contamination present in the camps. HRAP recommended that UNMIK make a public apology to the victims and their families, as well as take appropriate steps towards payment of adequate individual compensation for both material and moral damage to 138 members of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities who resided in the camps from 1999 [11]. Then in 2019, 55 Members of the European Parliament wrote to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, expressing dismay at the UN’s failure to remedy harm inflicted on ethnic minorities in Kosovo. The letter urges the Secretary General “to ensure that the victims of widespread lead poisoning at UN-run camps in Kosovo receive individual compensation, adequate health care and educational support” [9]. In 2019, the UNMIK expressed “profound regret” that hundreds of Roma [including Ashkali and Balkan Egyptian]  were poisoned by lead waste while living in camps run by the United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Yet the UNMIK did not offer an apology or individual compensations [8].",,"The 14 years of continuous failure of UNMIK and its international partners to find a durable solution for the Roma of the camps constitute multiple human rights violations, including of the right to life; the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; the right to health, including medical treatment; the right to a healthy environment; and the right to adequate housing. This failure is the subject of growing international criticism, including from UN human rights bodies and experts [7]. “Decades ago, UNMIK did not fulfil its mandate to promote and protect the rights of these children and their families,” the Special Rapporteur said.” Nothing will replace what these victims have lost, but now (2019) the United Nations has an opportunity to do what it can to atone for past mistakes"" [10].

It is more logical to develop already existing resorts, which currently are not working at full capacity.

The main attraction of Kazakhstan for European tourists - pieces of virgin nature such as Ile-Alatau National park. The tourism trend of latest years is popularization of ecotourism - tourism with the minimal impact on the environment. And ecotourism could become a hallmark of Almaty district.
Development of ecological tourism (scientific ecotourism, exploring ecotourism, bird watching, botanical tours, video and photo tours, ethnic tourism, etc.) is the prior task of the National park, which is stated in the General plan for development.
We claim for abandonment of ski resort construction on Kok-Zhaylyao on the territory of the Ile-Alatau National park. Along with that we are not against tourism development in the region. We are for development of ecotourism (that will not damage unique ecosystems of Trans-Ili Alatau), for development of already existing ski resorts and against development of elite tourism sector for public financing (i.e. our taxes) and leave thousands of Kazakhstani citizens with no favorite place for leisure and recreation!

“Save Sierra Madre Network Alliance (SSMNA), in its advocacy against mega-dams, recommends, first and foremost, a genuine comprehensive, participative and corrupt-free program for the restoration of our watersheds and forests.

The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.

" T.E.R.R.E non-governmental organization proposed an alternative plan for the management of the waste of Beirut and Mount Lebanon for one year. The project which is entitled “National Action plan for Waste Recycling and Sorting” promotes the protection of the environment, can be easily implemented and is cost effective.  According to Paul Abi Rached, founder and president of the organization, the NAWRAS transitional plan is Eco friendly and it can provide around $50 million for the government. The project consists of the mandatory sorting and separation of waste into organic, inorganic and hazardous material at the level of households, establishments, stores, restaurants, etc. by installing green and red garbage bins in the streets for the disposal of the separated waste. The waste is then collected by garbage trucks and transported to several facilities. Generally, the organic waste is carried to a composting plant, the inorganic waste is recycled and the hazardous waste is stored. Thus, the main purpose of the plan is to reduce the amount of waste dumped into the temporary landfills, including the one in Costa Brava, from 2400 tons/day to 300 tons/day.  ",,"According to Hassan Bazzi, the attorney who issued the lawsuit, the judge’s decision of closing the landfill after four months was appealed by Beirut Southern Suburbs municipalities Union. However, this decision can still be implemented since the court of appeal of Mount Lebanon did not come up with any judgement after the appeal. Nevertheless, Paul Abi Rached indicated that politicians and government actors are trying to postpone the court date by applying pressure on Judge Hasan Hamdan in order to change his decision of permanently closing the landfill.

Engaging Lebanese Content (https://www.the961.com/lebanons-highest-peak-qornet-el-sawda-will-be-turned-into-a-resort/); A Separate State of Mind (https://stateofmind13.com/2017/01/16/qornet-el-sawda-lebanons-highest-peak-to-be-ruined-turned-into-a-resort/); and AUB Outlook (http://outlookaub.com/2017/01/31/al-kumma-project-publics-uproar-2/).

_x000D_
Alternative 1, the No-action Alternative, would not authorize a Makah gray whale hunt._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternative 2, the Tribe’s Proposed Action Alternative, would allow harvest of four ENP 20 gray whales per year on average (with a maximum of five in any one year) and up to 21 whales in any 6-year period. Hunting would be allowed in the Tribe’s U&A outside the Strait of Juan de Fuca from December 1 to May 31. Hunting would not be allowed within 200 yards of Tatoosh Island and White Rock. The number of whales that could be struck would be limited to no more than seven in any calendar year and no more than 42 over the 6-year period, while the number of whales struck and lost would be limited to three annually and 18 over the 6-year period. The maximum number of whales struck in any year would be seven, and the maximum number struck and lost would be three. Under the proposed action alternative, in any year the hunt would cease if a calculated number of PCFG whales (based on the potential biological removal (PPR) formula used in NMFS’ MMPA stock assessment reports) were landed and identified. Current calculations result in a harvest limit estimate of 3.0 PCFG whales._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternative 3 would have the same conditions as Alternative 2 regarding numbers of ENP whales struck, struck and lost, and harvested; seasonal restrictions; and regulatory conditions. Alternative 3 would have the same hunt area as Alternative 2, except that it would prohibit Makah hunters from making an initial strike on a gray whale within 5 miles (8 km) of shore, and assumes an all-motorized hunt with no use of a canoe. Alternative 3 would also differ from Alternative 2 in its approach to managing impacts to the PCFG. It would set an annual total mortality limit for PCFG whales equal to the PBR as applied to PCFG whales in NMFS’ most recent MMPA stock assessment report. Current calculations result in a mortality limit estimate of 2.7 PCFG whales. This alternative would also have an additional annual mortality limit for female PCFG whales equal to one-half the PBR._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternative 4 would have the same conditions as Alternative 2 except the hunting season would be from June 1 through November 30, to avoid killing a Western North Pacific (WNP) whale (because such whales would be feeding in the WNP at this time and not present in the Makah U&A). Because hunting would be allowed during the period that defines membership in the PCFG, Alternative 4 would also include restrictions specifically intended to manage impacts to the PCFG. Key restrictions include avoiding female whales, setting an annual total mortality limit using the PBR approach described for Alternative 3 (but using a lower recovery factor and accounting for other sources of human26 caused mortality), and the presumption that all whales struck but not landed are PCFG whales. Current calculations result in a mortality limit estimate of 1 PCFG whale._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternative 5 would have the same conditions as Alternative 2, except there would be two hunting seasons of 3 weeks each: one from December 1 through December 21 and one from May 10 through May 31. This split-season approach is intended to avoid killing a WNP whale and to minimize the chance of killing a PCFG whale. Alternative 5 would also differ from Alternative 2 by setting an annual PCFG mortality limit at 10 percent of PBR. Current calculations result in a mortality limit estimate of 0.27 PCFG whales. This alternative would also count any whale struck but not landed as a PCFG whale in proportion to the observed presence of PCFG whales in the Makah U&A during that season._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternative 6 would have the same conditions as Alternative 2, except that strikes would be limited to seven over 2 years and an annual PCFG mortality limit would be set using the PBR formula as applied to the PCFG in NMFS’ most recent stock assessment report (minus other sources of human-caused mortality). Current calculations result in a mortality limit estimate of 2.25 PCFG whales. Alternative 6 would also differ from Alternative 2 by counting all whales struck but not landed against the PCFG limit based on their proportional presence during the season they were struck and lost. In addition, the waiver of the MMPA take moratorium would expire 10 years after adoption, and regulations governing the hunt would limit the term of any hunt permit to not more than 3 years.		_x000D_

"The 'Urban Street Design Guidelines Pune' project has set out with the stated vision of ‘re-establishing streets as experiential public spaces that offer citizens to use all modes of transport, including walking with a safe and dependable commuting experience.’ 
Within this initiative is the Pune Cycle Plan (PCP) which adopts a multi-step process of understanding the concerns and needs of cyclists in the city and which subsequently gives detailed technical recommendations on how to meet them effectively. The pedestrian paths themselves are to be made free of obstacles and smooth for wheelchair usage, while the cycling tracks are to be segregated with physical barriers that prevent encroaching by motor vehicles. Further, these cycling tracks are to be connected on a greater scale so that accessing more distant parts of the city on bicycle is possible. For even greater distances, the guidelines also include creating a network of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes for an uninterrupted public transportation experience. Other design elements include providing shade trees to pedestrian and cyclists, traffic calming speed-breakers in residential areas, intuitive universal signage (traffic signals etc.), street furniture (seating, trash bins etc.) and other features. ",,"As far as conceptualising a vision for an alternative transportation system that is based on equitable access and sustainability is concerned, the project can be considered as a success. However, the project is lagging behind in implementation. By the original timeline of the project, a draft plan was to be placed before the Pune Municipal Corporation General Body by September-October 2016. Instead the corporation felt a need for an additional survey to obtain a more updated data-set on the feasibility of creating a cycle share program. The consultants hired to carry out this survey have submitted their report, but there has been no discussion on the matter as of December 2016. 
While the municipal commissioner is enthusiastic about the project, the structure of the corporation is a potential hurdle to successful implementation of the project guidelines. The final responsibility of implementing design schemes lies with the corporators of each ward and not all of them share the same interest as the commissioner does. This seems to be an important determinant, as observed in road maintenance on current stretches of roads and existing cycle tracks.
A more serious impediment however could be the metro link project that has been approved by the corporation simultaneously, under the Smart City plan of the central government. The metro project was not part of the comprehensive mobility plan for Pune, and is not a recommendation of the technical consultants. The estimated cost of building a metro network is 10,500 crore rupees with the stated aim of transporting 7 lakh people per day by 2031. However, the existing bus network in Pune already transports more than 10 lakh people per day. The relationship between the metro project and the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is thus not mutually complimentary. In fact the commissioner himself has been quoted as saying that ‘the metro is a glamour project, but that the future lies in the bicycle.’ As such, the go-ahead given to the metro project seems like a move made under pressure from the larger political machinery of the state and the country, in keeping with the grandiose neoliberal vision of ‘smart’ cities. 
In summary, this case cannot yet be considered an environmental justice success since it is still in the planning stage, and faces issues of both implementation and interference in the time to come.

Protestors also want the road connectivity from each of the 43 villages to the Major District Roads (MDRs). They demand state highways to be built and to keep them in good condition perennially.

Indispensable dialogue and consent between all the interested and affected parties and awareness
campaign should be organized.
Highly valuable areas like natural reserves and areas of special importance for food security must be excluded from uranium mining.
• Perspectives:
 The Selous Game Reserve area could be further developed into a tourist attraction spot.
• Measures for storage of radioactive waste are required;
• Uranium should be included in the (draft) guideline of the European Union on Responsible sourcing of
minerals originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (guideline towards an integrated EU
approach).
• Involved stakeholders, multinational companies and nuclear energy consuming countries should
recognize and take their responsibility and fulfill criteria of corporate accountability;
• The whole fuel chain of nuclear power should be more transparent and more monitored.
• Nuclear energy (with all its negative consequences as e.g. uranium mining) should be abandoned. (2)
A proper cooperation among different authorities is required, and a system of inspections and monitoring of uranium exploration and/or mining sites must be available.

The community in collaboration with Rebuild By Design developed an earlier plan [also see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpNSTg6LXs  and  http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/data/files/675.pdf starting at p. 50 for East River Park] which was more reflective of our diverse community and our needs. The community plan was more comprehensive in providing flood protection without destroying the park. This community plan was summarily scrapped by the city and they are now planning to bring in the bulldozers next March. But together we can stop this misguided and destructive scheme._x000D_
_x000D_
Unlike city scheme which singularly focuses on building a massive billion dollar flood barrier, the community plan addresses flood protection in the larger context of the climate crisis. That is, it would provide much needed flood protection by expanding the park and reducing greenhouse emissions in response to this crisis. The city’s $1.45 billion allocated for their scheme must be redirected to a plan that will serve the needs of our community first rather than the needs of traffic on the FDR Drive. In fact it appears that the temporary closing of one lane of the Drive, required by the Rebuild By Design options to construct the berm along the FDR, was the main reason the city scrapped them for its “preferred option.” The following lays out the elements of a community plan:_x000D_
1.	Rebuild By Design options v. NYC “Preferred Option 4”_x000D_
As everyone knows by now the city’s current plan- Option 4- will bulldoze the entire park and dump 8-10 feet of landfill on it. The phrase “phased construction means phased destruction” voices our disagreement with the “concession” by Community Board 3 that would allow this plan to move forward by destroying the park one section at a time instead of all at once. The earlier options prepared by Rebuild By Design with community input over five years are far less destructive. The last option presented to the community, before the city scrapped the entire planning process, required only 1/3 of the park (along the western edge adjoining the FDR Drive) to be altered or bulldozed. Unlike Option 4, the Rebuild By Design options envision East River Park as a flood plain in their drawings. The removal of the astroturf and restoration of real soil and grass on the ballfields and other areas of the park would be an important element in creating a more sustainable green space. In contrast, with temperatures regularly climbing over 100 degrees, it’s hard to imagine the restoration of nature atop the city’s Option 4 dirt pile. More likely we’ll see a new park of fake grass and maybe even plastic trees and shrubs like the potted “plants” in corporate lobbies._x000D_
 _x000D_
2.	Decking _x000D_
The Rebuild By Design options envisioned decking over the FDR Drive which would greatly expand East River Park and allow for far more trees and green space, which are essential in combatting climate change. The FDR Drive is already decked in a number of sections, the largest being Carl Schurz Park waterfront promenade from East 84th to East 90th Streets. In fact the Department of City Planning in its 2008 Inventory of Decking Opportunities Over Transportation Properties studied decking opportunities over additional sections of the Drive along with other highways (see attached). While these additional sections don’t include the roadway adjoining East River Park, the City Planning study at least establishes a rationale for what should be done. Rather than spending huge sums on the current plan to bulldoze and raise the park 8-10 feet, the resulting savings should go towards constructing decking over the section of the FDR Drive adjoining East River Park._x000D_
 _x000D_
3.	FDR Drive_x000D_
We've already put forth the logic behind shrinking the FDR Drive and introducing dedicated bus lanes https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/07/17/op-ed-to-save-the-east-river-coastline-first-get-rid-of-cars-on-the-fdr-drive/ . In addressing the issue of emissions released by the 100,000+ cars traveling the Drive each day, we now have to also consider the impact of congestion pricing which will be fully implemented in 2021. See https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/nyregion/what-is-congestion-pricing.html.  Congestion pricing will have the effect of incentivizing motorists who are passing through the city to travel on the FDR Drive or West Side Highway. As jammed as it is now, even a small increase in traffic may well turn the FDR into a parking lot of polluting vehicles with motors running. A public transportation alternative for the FDR will soon become even more of a priority for our community and especially for residents living along the Drive who already have some of the highest rates of asthma in the country._x000D_
 _x000D_
The above three elements represent a maximum program of demands- the whole enchilada- that needs to be adopted by the city. Clearly, there will be negotiating so maybe we should at least start out by envisioning ourselves as Extinction Rebellion with infrastructure funding and political power. But these proposals are not “visionary” as some will claim (they would have been visionary 30 years ago) but essential for our community’s survival and a model for what’s required to deal with the climate emergency. To be sure some of these ideas are “impractical” given the radical restructuring required to meet our current challenges. However, in a few short years if we fail to take concerted action, “practical” may mean desalinating sea water for drinking, rationing food and finding enough boats for all of us to get around.",,Community plan was canceled.

"Nicaragua’s waste picker organization RedNica urges the municipal and national governments to promote inclusive recycling policies [15]. In case of La Chureca, it proposed the formation of cooperatives as an alternative for expelled waste pickers, and demanded municipal support for these, for example in municipal waste collection with a separation at source system [1][2][7]. As an immediate measure, it demanded controlled access to the landfill for 320 affected waste pickers via an authentication system and the stop of violence by police and security forces [2][12].",,"As Hartmann (2018) concludes, the case of La Chureca demonstrates the limitations of inclusive neoliberal development policies in municipal solid waste management. Driven by a discourse of  “sustainable development” and technological innovation, the project aimed to equally improve environmental quality, to commodify solid waste as a means to increase economic profit, and to address the social and economic needs of the community. In doing so, however, the project and the implemented policies led to the displacement of hundreds of waste pickers, an uneven distribution of employment among different affected neighborhoods, and the continuation of informal waste picking due to persistent impoverishment.

The project ultimately led to the enclosure of Managua’s waste commons, which, as Zapata and Zapata Campos (2015) argue, had been created by dispossessed communities through the longstanding practice of waste-picking and the creation and appropriation of waste as a resource. Churequeros regarded the access to this commons as their earned right, as they had often spent most of the life working and living at the site, thereby enduring contamination and health risks. They have also undergone a process of empowerment through partly successful protests (as for example in 2008) and organizing in unions and cooperatives (as of 2015, 85 percent of all waste pickers in La Chureca were organized), leading to an increasing social and political recognition of the community. [6] As this case shows, the struggle for the recognition of waste picker rights and recycling initiatives in Managua is an ongoing one and some of the improvements made in La Chureca came with severe negative side effects on waste pickers who lost their livelihoods.",Not sure,In operation,displacement-of-waste-pickers-through-la-chureca-dumpsite-enclosure-managua-nicaragua,5.0,#ee2c2c,

2. Design (fuel and technology) alternatives for the site 
No other design alternative has been considered in the EIA. There may have been different technologies, or different fuels, but it seems that, due to the fact that coal provides the cheapest solution (if externalities and carbon costs are not to be paid), coal has a head start over other fuels.

Estas experiencias de solidaridad entre comunidades, científicos y ambientalistas de la región animaron la organización del Foro Estatal de basura en Alpuyeca, en marzo de 2008. En él se discutieron las problemáticas de basura de cada pueblo o ciudad de Morelos, y se promovió la creación de empresas comunitarias de gestión de basura y llevar a cabo acciones específicas para reducir la generación de basura. A su vez, se propuso una agenda de educación ambiental. Una semana después del foro, se realizó en la ciudad de Cuernavaca una semana de trabajo entre comunidades y expertos para explicar el problema de la basura y sus alternativas técnicas [1].",,"Aunque se impidió la entrada de más desechos, nunca se llevó a cabo un programa de biorremediación adecuado en la región, así como tampoco se presentaron en la comunidad brigadas de salud para atender las afecciones de los pueblos. Las salidas planteadas por el Estado ante el cierre del basurero de Milpillas fueron la confinación de los residuos en lugares inapropiados, la exportación de los mismos al Estado de México y la concesión del servicio de basura a empresas privadas, las cuales no acabaron de resolver el fenómeno y agudizaron la crisis socioambiental en la región. Un ejemplo fue la licitación otorgada a la empresa Promotora Ambiental S.A., para el manejo de residuos en Cuernavaca, a pesar de su larga lista de irregularidades y fraudes en el servicio ambiental de desechos tóxicos y urbanos. En julio de 2007, el gobierno anuncia públicamente la adquisición de un terreno en Loma de Mejía, Temixco: zona de recarga acuífera de la cual dependen 100 mil habitantes de la región, para la construcción del relleno sanitario donde la empresa depositaría la basura. Este hecho no se presentó sin conflicto; la negativa total de todos los pueblos de Morelos a convertirse en el nuevo Milpillas del Estado, se expresó en los constantes bloqueos carreteros impidiendo la entrada de los camiones de basura provenientes de Cuernavaca a sus tierras. La movilización contra el relleno sanitario de Loma de Mejía se desata en agosto de 2007. Pese a sus esfuerzos, el 6 de enero de 2009, la empresa deposita las primeras tres mil toneladas de basura en el sitio. El siguiente Presidente Municipal de Cuernavaca, Manuel Martínez Garrigós, decide no pagar el servicio y meter sus propias empresas y amigos.

"In June 2016, the Palestinian Environment Quality Authority (EQA) filed a notification with the Basel Convention Secretariat about an incident of two illegal truckloads of hazardous wastes sourced from Israel’s Nitzane Shalom (Geshuri) settlement industrial zone  that were caught en route in April 2016 heading to the Zahrit al-Finjan landfill (near Jenin). A 2011 Israeli state comptroller report provided that the industrial settlement (referred to as Mesila) is unauthorized and is constructed without building permits through the takeover of Palestinian lands. In addition, it is contrary to international law to even use this landfill for the disposal of hazardous wastes. According to the Oslo Accords, hazardous waste in the Occupied Palestinian Territory needs to be transported for appropriate disposal to an Israeli landfill because the respective Palestinian authorities have been restricted from developing an appropriate location for environmentally sound disposal of toxic wastes. 
In response to Palestine’s notification, Israel claimed that the waste was not theirs because it came from an industrial settlement. However, since responsibility for hazardous waste under the convention extends to ‘areas of jurisdiction’, this claim was dismissed by the Secretariat. According to the Basel Convention, a “transboundary movement” of waste entails the movement of waste from “an area under the national jurisdiction of one State” to another.  Areas of national jurisdiction include “any land, marine area or airspace within which a State exercises administrative and regulatory responsibility in accordance with international law in regard to the protection of human health or the environment”.  Israeli settlements are under full Israeli control as Israeli civil legislation regulates settlements authority institutions and applies extraterritorially to individual Israeli settlers. 
Following the mediated negotiation process provided by the Basel Convention Secretariat, Palestine succeeded in winning an agreement from Israel for the waste to be transferred back across the Green Line, to be appropriately disposed of in Israel. This is a significant victory for Palestine, demonstrating one possible way to use international environmental law to hold Israel accountable for violating the environmental and human rights of Palestinians and seek appropriate remedies. However, in accepting the consequences of its criminal actions, Israel has demanded that the case not be published on the Basel Convention website.

While the activists denounced the report as unfair and one-sided and argued against its legal relevance, the government argued that the TBTAK report essentially neutralized the decision of the court and gave Eurogold the green light to operate.
Failing to score a decisive legal victory in Turkey, the movement also took its case to the European Court of Human Rights. In its 2004 decision, the court found that the state of Turkey had indeed violated the activists procedural rights and awarded 3000 euros each to the 315 individuals taking part in the lawsuit. However, the ECHR refused to back the activists in their calls to order Turkey to shut down the mine.","In the environmental justice realm, Bergama constituted an example to other movements because of its high visibility and long resistance.

While this has been a major set-back for the project, the future of the proposed resort remains unclear. Pheidias Project Management Corporation, who are in charge of managing the resort project, said that they are still to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada or proceed with a smaller scale version of the resort project (status 15/9/19) [9]._x000D_
_x000D_
On the other hand, in the legal dispute between the Ktunaxa First Nation and the B.C. province which was taken to Canada’s Supreme Court, the court’s decision ruled against the Ktunaxa blocking the development of the resort on their sacred site. The Ktunaxa saw this ruling as an indication that Indigenous peoples, their spirituality and intrinsic link to the land cannot be legally protected [6, 10]. Given that land development and expropriation issues continue to impact Indigenous communities across Canada [11], this ruling was regarded as a blow to Indigenous peoples’ rights and did not serve environmental justice._x000D_
_x000D_
However, end of August 2019, the Ktunaxa First Nation council have received approval for funding from Environment and Climate Change Canada for the development of an Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area, up to 211,045 hectares, in the Qat’muk area (Jumbo Valley) of the central Purcell Mountain range [2, 12]. The Ktunaxa Nation will receive $16 million to protect the valley including its biodiversity and cultural values once the details around the contribution are agreed [12]. This is seen as a major step in the recognition of the environmental and spiritual value of the valley [2]. _x000D_

Given these developments and the most recent court ruling deeming the environmental assessment certificate of the proposed Jumbo Glacier project invalid, it can overall be deemed an environmental justice success to date.

The court also went beyond the CLC and IOPC Fund conventions by recognising the moral damages and the ecological damages incurred. In the case of the Prestige, a decision in November 2017 by the court of A Coruña prevented the shipowner and insurer from invoking the compensation limits set out in the 1992 CLC convention and thus granted considerably higher sums to the affected parties than the amounts defined by the international regime.

"FULENI MCEJO MEMORANDUM – 21 st April 2016 
The Honourable Minister of Mineral Resources: Mr Mosebenzi Zwane 
Regional Mining Development Environmental Committee (RMDEC) 
Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Ingonyama Trust Board (ITB) 
cc The South African Human Rights Commission 
The Office of the Public Protector 
21 April 2016 
Dear Honourable Minister Zwane
We, the members of Mfolozi Community Environmental Justice Organisation (MCEJO) and the Fuleni community wish to bring to your attention that we are fed up with the corruption of the majority of members of the Mhlana Traditional Council and the willingness of the government to sell the Fuleni people's land to Ibutho Coal and its foreign investors while sacrificing the lives, health and livelihoods of the residents of Fuleni, particularly the seven mining affected communities: Ocilwane, Novunula, Fuyeni, Ntuthunga 1 and 2, Emakhwezini, and Shayamoya.
Today's demonstration, on 21 April 2016, is also to show RMDEC and DMR that we are totally opposed to Ibutho Coal's proposed Fuleni coal mine on our land.
The march is an expression of our frustration at not being consulted and not having our voices heard no matter how loudly and clearly we say “No to mining”.
We ask why the government is entertaining Ibutho Coal, a prospecting company, with no proven experience of mining. Also we call on the Ingonyama Trust Board to intervene as the trustees of our tribal land and ensure that the needs and rights of the affected communities are considered and parotected.
The demonstration is to make it clear to the corrupt leadership and authorities that enough is enough. Ibutho Coal we do not want to see you back on our land.
Mining is not development. No matter how much the government tries to push the lie that mining creates jobs for the local communities or that the people living close to mines benefit., we know otherwise because already we are living close to Tendele's Somkhele coal mine. 
We know from regular contact with the Somkhele communities and other mining affected communities in Mpumalanga and Limpopo that mining brings death and suffering; steals our agricultural and grazing land; pollutes air and water; poisons the soil; splits communities apart; shatters the peace of rural living with explosions; cracks our houses; breaks our windows; brings suffering to our old people, children and our livestock; and only benefits already wealthy shareholders and directors but leaves local people impoverished. It also If living next to mining is so beneficial, we wonder why rich privileged people do not decide to relocate their homes and families to eMahleni? 
We are feeling the effects of coal-related climate change and so strongly oppose the continued use and extraction of fossil fuels. The devastating drought here in Fuleni is expected to occur more frequently and become more extreme yet the government is agreeing to thirsty coal mines stealing our water, another constitutional right we are being robbed of.
We stand together with MACUA, GET, CCS – UKZN, groundWork, WoMin, EarthLore, the Amadiba Crisis Committee, the Mpukinyoni Community Property Association (MPCA), Yes to Life No to Mining, The Gaia Foundation, Grrrowd, and many other support organisations to demand: 
- The dissolution of the existing Traditional Council because of the high level of corruption amongst the majority of traditional leaders and their lack of interest in the needs of the people, and replaced with councillors who are concerned about the well-being of the Mthethwa communities and have our best interests at heart; 
- Nothing about us and our land without us; 
- No form of mining in Fuleni, specifically coal mining, fracking, marble mining. No government will convince us that we will benefit from mining or that it will improve our lives. We know that mining equals death. We do not want to experience the same bloodshed on our land as at Marikana and at Xolobeni because the Department of Mineral Resources is so willing to open doors to exploitative investors who not only destroy the environment but split communities apart; 
- Free access to information and freedom of speech as enshrined in the Constitution. We do not accept that for almost a year the Traditional Council has blocked attempts by the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (DEDTEA) and Uthungulu District Municipality to hold a Public Participation Imbizo for the Fuleni communities as we requested in June 2015; 
- No corruption of any kind and no intimidation, oppression, harrassment, and disregard for human rights and basic democratic processes, or threats to people's lives will be tolerated.
MCEJO, with this memorandum, wants to send a clear message and set our position to claim back what is rightfully ours and to put an end to corruption in Fuleni and any talk of Ibutho Coal and mining. Therefore, we call upon the Minister of Mineral Resources, RMDEC, the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to implement the will of MCEJO and the Fuleni people.

In this regard, Ferrous discursively linked its decision to the unfavorable economic scenario at the time, given the significant drop in the price of iron ore in the international market. However, the company's stance can also be attributed to its interest in detaching its conduct from the pockets of resistance encountered during the procedure._x000D_
The perception of those potentially affected by the pipeline follows a different path: the non-construction of the pipeline meant, in the symbolic field, victory and empowerment, which is very important to demonstrate the relevance and effectiveness of social mobilization in struggles to guarantee rights. In this perspective, social mobilization was recognized as the preponderant factor for the withdrawal manifested by Ferrous, without, however, disregarding the importance of the international economic scenario for the outcome of the conflict. In this way, the environmental conflict gave rise to the construction of environmental justice both in material terms, with the removal of the unfair situation, and in symbolic terms, with the change in the field of values of the populations affected by the pipeline, since the achievements in terms of empowerment were strongly highlighted by actors linked to resistance._x000D_

Al 30 de septiembre de 2013 se cumplió este periodo y el alcalde de Bucaramanga, Luis Francisco Bohórquez, decretó nuevamente una prórroga a la emergencia sanitaria por un plazo máximo de 24 meses, justificada por “el riesgo inminente de calamidad pública ambiental” y en su “deber de evitar un problema de salud pública que puede afectar a toda el área

"An alternative to the bill C-18 was presented by the National Farmers Union. They proposed that Canada developed and implemented a Seed Act for Farmers that would allow farmers to retain customary use of seed. The fundamental principles of such a law include:
- The right of farmers to exchange and sell seed, including through farmer‐owned organisations
such as cooperatives, non‐profit organisations and associations.
- The unrestricted right of farmers to grow, save and use seed for planting which cannot be negated by any contract. This right would be supported by
— unrestricted right to clean seed
— unrestricted right to store seed
— unrestricted right to prepare seed for planting, including applying seed treatments
— unrestricted establishment of new seed cleaning plants  
— unrestricted access to seed cleaning equipment and parts.
- Seed cleaning operations are an integral part of the seed system and thus
— shall not be prosecuted  for the cleaning of protected varieties for a third party
— cannot be compelled to give out their client lists.
- Plant breeders rights legislation that would confer the right to claim royalties only at the time of
seed sale. (i.e. no endpoint royalties or cascading rights).
-Following expiration of plant breeders rights, varieties would be in the public domain allowing for unrestricted use and/or made available under a general public license.
- The opportunity for farmers and other non‐accredited plant breeders to register new varieties.
- A variety registration system that would protect farmers and our food system by ensuring seed that meets farmers’ needs for quality, reliability and agronomic performance under local conditions across Canada is available. This system would make distinctions in requirements for varieties to be used in conventional or organic production when necessary. Such a system would:
— ensure that varieties remain in the public domain following the expiration of plant breeders’ rights;  
— allow varieties to be registered under a general public license to ensure that such varieties remain freely available to farmers and public plant breeders;
— prohibit cancellation of varieties by the variety registrant;  
— allow the cancelling of registration for varieties only if evidence, including input from Recommending Committees, supported the cancellation;
— have an accessible public appeal mechanism regarding registration and deregistration of varieties to support the public interest. For example, to prevent the registration of unwanted genetically modified varieties; to maintain registration of older varieties;
— require robust, independent third‐party merit testing for new varieties to ensure they are as good as or better than existing varieties, which takes into account market harm, ecological impacts, multiple farming systems, nutrition, disease resistance and other
relevant factors;  
— formally recognize the value of land races that are not intended to have uniformity and stability as defining characteristics, establishing mechanisms to allow  heritage plant varieties such as Red Fife Wheat to be utilised in appropriate rotations and markets  
- A dispute settlement process that uses due process that would ensure  
      — inspection and sampling would be done only with the farmer’s explicit permission and in the presence of, and verified by, a qualified neutral third party.
      — binding arbitration carried out by a public commission would settle questions of infringement, etc. between farmers and companies. Such a commission would be modelled on the process used by the Canadian Grain Commission in settling grain grading disputes.
- No possibility that the production of seed could ever be considered counterfeiting or a violation of trademark.
- Prohibition of Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs), sometimes referred to as Terminator Technology.

However, the judge found that the significant financial costs of the injunction outweighed these religious factors. Following this ruling, Barrick began project construction. 
On 6 February 2009 the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs requested the appeals court to issue a preliminary injunction staying further ground disturbance and construction of the Project. Furthermore, the plaintiffs explained that they did not seek to disturb those parts of the Project that would not affect Mt. Tenabo, allowing Barrick to continue with the planned expansion approximately 8 miles away from the mountain.

In February 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court requesting that it issue a full injunction to halt the Project.

One of the major arguments used to support the pipeline project has been that it will aid Poland’s transition from coal to natural gas and thereby reduce carbon emissions, given that gas is the comparably less polluting fossil energy source. Estimates from Polish side have pointed to a steady increase in the use of gas over the next many years, despite Poland’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, and the country faces the difficult challenge of transitioning thousands of mining jobs to other industries. At the same time, the country’s effort to diversify its energy supply away from its Russian neighbour has been the major geopolitical driver of this project.

The failure to understand the waste pickers’ lives has often resulted in the development of solutions to deal with the city’s waste that do not build on the value systems created by the local communities. Local processes have been considered demeaning, backward, exploitative and inefficient. As City Hall contemplates the future of solid waste management in Phnom Penh, “officials need to also incorporate and involve waste pickers and the dynamic informal recycling sector within the city’s formal solid waste management processes”, Bryson argues.

"The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on the governments in ship-owning countries (in particular: the EU and its Member States, Japan, China, Singapore, and the US) to prohibit the export of end-of-life vessels to South Asian shipbreaking countries as long as:
- end-of-life vessels contain significant amounts of hazardous waste;
- the shipbreaking countries cannot prove that all hazardous waste is removed, stored, treated, disposed or destructed in an environmantally sound manner;
- working and living conditions of shipbreaking workers remain inadequate;
- shipbreaking does not take place in modern ship recycling facilities off the beach with minimum technical and infrastructural requirements allowing for the containment of pollutions and workers’ health and safety.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on ship owner to only sell their end-of-life vessels to modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. By 2016, it is expected that the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards globally. The Platform will be recommending the use of these yards to ship owners.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its member organisations in Bangladesh recommend the following actions to the Government of Bangladesh, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:
- The Government needs to close down all shipbreaking yards which do not operate in accordance with the Supreme Court rulings, operate without Environmental Clearances based on the assessment of their performance, or operate illegally on forest land, where mangrove trees have been cut illegally.  
- The Government must ensure that yard owners are held responsible for severe injures and deaths resulting from a lack of adequate infrastructe, equipment, oversight or training. So far, no yard owner has been held responsible for their negligence and breach of the law.
- The Government needs to ensure that no child or adolescent workers under the age of 18 work in the shipbreaking yards. Yards in which workers under 18 are found, need to be sanctioned and eventually closed down if illegal child labour is not stopped. The shipbreaking sector must be taken into account in the Government’s strategy to eradicate worst forms of child labour.
- The Government together with the relevant local authorities should develop and implement a «Green Ship Recycling Strategy», that is, a cross-departmental policy to allow for the much needed shift towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention, the ILO and the IMO.
- The Government should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure to develop modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. 
- The «Green Ship Recycling Strategy» should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer and environmentally sound methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).
- The Government of Bangladesh should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia – India and Pakistan – in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a ‘level playing field’ is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.
- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Supreme Court rulings and obligations under international law, the Government needs to develop sector-specific shipbreaking rules. The new regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between different government agencies at the national and local level and needs to clearly define the competent authorities’ roles.
- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention (in particular Prior Informed Consent and Environmentally Sound Management of hazardous wastes) as well as the standards set out in the new EU Ship Recycling Regulation.
- The new regulation needs to set out the authorisation criteria for facilities, to establish a set of rules for facility operation, including the procedures to obtain permits for different kinds of hazardous work, clearly define which authority needs to issue certificates and approvals, and set up an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation’s requirements.
- With regards to hazardous waste management, the “Green Ship Recycling Strategy” needs to include a plan to establish: a reception facility for operationally and non-operationally generated waste at a port close to the yards with a mandatory port call for all imported end-of-life vessels to perform cleaning activities such as cleaning cargo tanks, emptying bilge tanks, paint and chemical stores, and unloading waste oil and surplus fuel, waste storage on the yards, waste reception facilities such as a sanitary landfill, disposal treatment facility for hazardous waste such as PCBs, a system to track hazardous waste and to avoid the repartition into the market, establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.
- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should provide a training center and seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training. Adequate training must be a pre-requirement for work in the shipbreaking yards. Workers needs to be handed out certificates and training efforts needs to be documented.
- With regards to workers’ rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, the immediate improvement of workers’ living conditions including drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.
- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a new draft law on asbestos safety.
- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary (for instance in the local Labour Court). Compliance needs to be monitored especially with regards to: workers’ registration for social benefits, provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), application of environmental, health and safety procedures, use of obligatory on-site pollution control and safety gadgets, periodic monitoring of maintenance and improvements of on-site equipment, provision of sufficient, improved and satisfactory on-site health care system, adequate training status of workers and awareness of hazards, maintenance of hazardous waste inventory and disposal.
- The Government of Bangladesh should ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, thus prohibit the import of hazardous waste, and the Hong Kong Convention and seek early compliance with the provisions under the latter. Moreover, the Government should enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention and seek guidance also from the EU Ship Recycling Regulation's standards for ship recycling facilities.
- The Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify “hot spots” that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations’ expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense and the Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.
- The Government needs to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking. They need to allow for transparency and enhance civil society involvement. Moreover, they should embrace the active participation of trade unions and promote their independent and democratic structures.",,"Significant decisions towards environmental and social protection have been taken by the Supreme Court in Bangladesh. Several imports of vessels have been stopped by the Courts on the grounds that Bangladesh should not import toxic wastes. In 2009 all shipbreaking yards were required to close as none of them had the necessary environmantal permits to operate. In 2014 some of the yards situated where 14 000 mangrove trees were illegaly cut were eveicted and the Courts also ordered the replanting of the trees. The court ordered the consolidation of laws relevant for shipbreaking in line with both environmantal protection and workers' rights. 
However, most of the court's orders have been ignored by both the Government and the industry. 
The Bangladeshi ship breaking industry remains a hazardous industry for both workers and the environment.  Since 2009 most yards have been able to re-open based on environmental permits with extended deadlines for complience with relevant environmental requirements. Though illegal by Bangladesh law, children still make up about 20% of the workforce. Bangladesh remains the second most favoured destination for ship owners looking for maximum profits when selling their old ships.  
So far little attention has been given to the sector by governmental agencies.
Due to the lack of adequate technology and equipment as well as deficient law enforcement, proper waste handling procedures are not followed. So far, the sector can neither prevent pollution and the distribution of hazardous materials into the local market nor mitigate the risks of accidents and occupational diseases.
There is still no hazardous waste management system for the shipbreaking yards in Bangladesh. Hazardous waste store houses are empty and not in use. There is no asbestos landfil, no waste treatment facility, such as an incinerator for PCBs, and the yards do not have water treatment plants.

Although only in its very early stages, the building of Bhasha dam appears fraught with difficulty, death and disruption. The police fired on protesters in Chilas who were angry at the way in which those affected by the building of the new - and essential - dam were being treated. They were demanding a share of the royalties generated by the dam, an increase in the compensation awarded to them and resolution of the border dispute between Gilgit-Baltistan and NWFP. Two protesters died in the firing, others were injured and the local populace displayed their displeasure by burning down the offices of the assistant commissioner, the superintendent of police and two police checkpoints. They also burned government vehicles and blocked Karakoram Highway in both directions for several hours ? and all this before work on the dam has got into top gear.

"Because it doesn’t emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases when electricity is produced, it is frequently referred to as “clean” energy. However, nuclear energy is too expensive, too slow to implement, the nuclear power plants are dangerous and vulnerable, and the nuclear waste is highly radioactive and toxic. It is therefore necessary to develop alternatives.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The following are some nuclear energy substitutes:  _x000D_
_x000D_
Thorium   _x000D_
_x000D_
59% of the world's thorium reserves are located in Turkey, India, Australia, and the United States. While just 1% of the mined uranium is used as fuel, thorium can be used as a fuel. Thorium is less wasteful and more expensive than uranium. _x000D_
_x000D_
Solar Energy  _x000D_
_x000D_
Solar energy never runs out. The finest alternative energy source is this particular one. Sunlight may be converted into power using solar panels. Solar power can be utilized as fuel for vehicles. The process is known as solar gasification. In this method, biomass is heated to 2,370 degrees Fahrenheit using focused solar electricity. As a result, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced, which can then be converted into gasoline and diesel fuel.  _x000D_
_x000D_
Natural gas _x000D_
_x000D_
It can serve as fuel for transportation. It is superior to oil. When burned, it produces fewer emissions of carbon and other air pollutants. Now that we have the technology, we can liberate vast quantities of natural gas that have been trapped in shale rock. _x000D_
_x000D_
Hydrogen  _x000D_
_x000D_
Burning hydrogen is clean. Compared to a gasoline-powered engine, it is three times more efficient. It can be used for transportation alongside a fuel cell. Using biomass, fossil fuels, or electrolyzing water, hydrogen can be produced.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The use of nuclear power can be replaced by a variety of options. Some of these have been on the market for many years. It is obvious that we should switch from nuclear power to them. ",,"We believe that the environmental justice is not served for several reasons. First, the Orano plant expose the local residents, particularly low-income, to increased health risks due to radiation exposure.

In addition, the decision-making has been criticized for its lack of transparency. And finally, the nuclear waste management and storage is not evenly distributed across society and low-income communities face a disproportionate share of the risks and impacts. _x000D_

She was gunned down by assassins hired by local ranchers. Dorothy's tireless work for the rights of the dispossessed and the protection of the Amazon rainforest stood in the way of the profits of logging and cattle ranching. Since her murder, people gather each year in late July to remember Dorothy and to recommit to the work of justice and land reform by walking the Romaria da Floresta (Pilgrimage of the Forest), a 34-mile journey from Anapu, Pará, Brasil, where Dorothy is buried to the middle of a dirt road in the Boa Esperança Sustainable Development Project where she was murdered. Last July I had the opportunity to go to Brazil and walk the same roads Sister Dorothy walked in her last days, to walk with the people for whom she lived and died. Over 200 people took part in this 10th pilgrimage: families and friends who knew Dorothy, youth groups, university students and professors, priests and sisters from many dioceses and religious congregations, journalists, environmentalists, young and old. As each day began, we gathered to sing and pray, to listen to Scripture, and to ponder questions that connected the ongoing struggle for justice to our lives of faith.

The off-shore port project would allow both not to dig new canals into the lagoon, preserving the environmental balance, and avoiding that the ships traffic could be limited by the closure of the MOSE system. The off-shore port would be connected with the city and the Marittima terminal through small/medium size boats.

It provides the excavation of a new canal with a width of 180m and a depth of 10.5m. The project also includes the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for the protection of the lagoon beds [17]. This project present risks concerning the modification of the current's speed within the lagoon and the erosion of lagoon beds.
-	“Tangential lagoon project”, proposed by Enrico Zanetti and then developed by the Venice Passenger Terminal (VPT) which presented a preliminary project called “Canale Grande Capacità Sud Giudecca” [20], provides the transit of the big ships in the rear of the Giudecca island trough a new canal  with a width of 160m, depth of 10.5m and a length of about 2km. In this case there would be the same impacts, on environment and on architectural heritage, caused by thecurrent route in Giudecca canal.
-	New touristic terminal at Marghera, presented by the study of Arch. D’Agostino and supported even by the City Council of Venice, involves the construction of a new tourist port near the VEGA building, exploiting the disused industrial areas [21]. With this project the risks is both to overlap the cruise ship traffic with the commercial traffic, and to modify the hydro-morphological balance of the lagoon.",,"Since many years the Comitato NO Grandi Navi and the environmental venetian associations are fighting against the route of the cruise ships into the Venetian Lagoon, denouncing the evident contrast between the transit of the big ships with the preservation law for the lagoon and historic centre of Venice.

On the contrary, the situation got worsened and vast land of the project area covered under polder 24 comprising 27 beels (large depression area) and at least 144 villages in the Abhaynagar, Keshabpur and Monirampur Upazilla started experiencing unprecedented water logging for indefinite period as natural drainage channels got silted and the sluice gates set up under the projects lost efficacy due to increased siltation and evidently no effective dredging.
In 1997, local people introduced a process called Tidal River Management (TRM) and tested the same in Keshabpur under Jessore. Under TRM approach, tidal water enters only in one tidal basin developed in a suitable beel with dykes and closures and deposits huge amount of silt that fills the bed of the beel in 3-4 years. They removed embankment encircling the Beel Bhaina in Keshabpur to allow tidal flow of water into the beel area. The TRM introduced by local people significantly reduced the water logging problem in Keshabpur and helped raising the land level of the beel with siltation. 
This approach enhanced the scope for mitigating drainage congestion and people recommended that new TRM should be established every 3-4 years on a rotating basis to ensure that water congestion of all areas are resolved by raising level of beel areas through sedimentation. 
Unfortunately, adamant position of BWDB against interference with existing structures and absence of firm commitment from the government agencies to pay compensation to land owners whose lands shall be under water for at least three years to allow TRM led to no agreements on TRM in new areas including in beel Khukshia, Kapalia and Baruna. 
As water logging took a severe form in 2005, local people started writing to the government actors to remove water from their villages, homestead, academic institutions, roads and all other infrastructure and also to protect their lives, properties, safety and health from the curse of such water logging attributable solely due to the unplanned structural interventions of KJDRP and other previous projects. They also appealed to the government to compensate them for the financial loss sustained due to the waterlogging. The demands from the people were considered in a meeting on 25.11.2005 that in the presence of three concerned members of Parliament decided that the situation would be handled on an emergency basis like war situation and that siltation from Sree-Hari-Teka rivers would be removed to drain out water to enable people to cultivate boro crop. Unfortunately, the situation was not handled as promised and people, having not received any effective and adequate administrative reliefs, under the banner of Progoti Samajkallyan Sangstha (Progress Social Welfare Agency) approached two national level NGOs on 04-04-2006 to take their grievances to the High Court. A Public Interest Litigation was filed by two NGOs in the form of Writ Petition (No. 7123 of 2006). The Court on 13-08-2006 directed the government actors to provide all services, products, goods and supports required to ensure that that the affected villagers are safely located and are receiving food, water, medicine and other essentials during the period of water loggings. The Court also directed pumping out of water from the affected villages for ensuring recession of water logging. 
The High Court also required the government to show cause as to why they shall not be directed to form an appropriate committee to permanently solve the problem of water logging in the three Upazillas of Keshabpur, Manirampur, and Abhaynagar. ",,"Although the High Court Division gave a set of interim orders and the government took initiative for TRM in some of the beels, the initiative stopped as the local people demanded compensation for TRM that keep their lands under water for a certain period of time and hence render the same unproductive. The water logging situation aggravated in the years 2008, 2014 and 2016 and people are yet to be freed permanently from the same.  ",Not sure,In operation,bhobodoho-water-logging,5.0,#ee2c2c,

Este tipo de estudios donde se discute la posibilidad de hacer compatible el desarrollo economico con la conservacion son de alta complejidad y trascienden los criterios tecnicos para pasar a los politicos y a las percepciones de la sociedad sobre la importancia de ambos aspectos.

la posibilidad de sustitucion entre el capital natural y el capital creado por la sociedad. En este caso la posibilidad de que el crecimiento economico asociado a la construccion de un puerto genere los recursos suficientes que compensen el impacto ambiental y social generado por el puerto.

On 16th March, 2010 the Court required all government agencies to show cause as to why they shall not be directed to-
- Correctly identify the borders of the Modhupur Sal Forest;
- Frame rules on village forestry as required under Section 28 of the Forest Act 1927 and ensure regeneration of the Modhupur Sal Forest through protection and enrichment plantation with indigenous species and with directed participation of the forest dependent people is envisaged in Section 28 of the Forest Act, 1927;
- Settle the rights of the member of the Garo and Kontch community who are indigenous forest dwellers of the Modhupur Sal Forest in accordance with section 92 of the SAT and following sections 6-19 of the Forest Act, 1927;
- Remove all unauthorized and illegal industrial/commercial entitles from the Modhupur Sal Forest;
- Stop commercial Banana/Pineapple plantation (without affecting the traditional cultivation of the tribal People) and other commercial plantations in the Modhupur Sal Forest;
- In the case of areas covered under social forestry agreements, undertake appropriate measures to gradually regenerate native forest in the said areas after the expiry of the existing agreements and/or such other further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.

Favourable ruling towards the Government of Quebec and the Grand Council of Cree’s First Nation in the Strateco Resources Inc. lawsuit filed in 2013_x000D_
New Environmental Impact and Assessment Study_x000D_
Permanent ban on uranium mining in Quebec indefinitely","On June 21, 2017 the Superior Court of Quebec rejected an appeal from Strateco Resources Inc. against the Attorney General of Quebec on behalf of the Government of Quebec and the Minister of the Environment. The presiding judge the Honorable Denis Jacques rejected Strateco's claim of $182,684,575 for the loss of its investment in the Matoush uranium project and an additional $10 million in punitive damages. This decision by the SCQ was undoubtedly a major win for environmentalists and First Nations advocates, as it set a precedent future mining companies trying to extract financial compensation from a development project after a government moratorium. However, the moratorium on uranium mining in Quebec can still be revoked by a simply change in government or public policy, as the court did not rule on the legality of the moratorium remaining in-place indefinitely. As a result, until a law is passed by the Quebec National Assembly (which is unlikely) then uranium mining in Northern Quebec and at the Matoush Project near Mistissini still has the possibility of being revived at a future date. In the meantime, the residents in the nearby Cree community of Mistissini will be left to worry about the ultimate fate of this massive (now abandoned) uranium project in their backyard.
 
At the same time this verdict was reached by the Superior Court of Quebec, the James Bay Cree First Nation groups used the opportunity to mention the many other mining activities still occurring in their region outside of uranium. In Northern Quebec, exploratory mining and industrial development is extensive, including other valuable minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron ore, zinc, lead, and chromium. Other mining activities such as these have been increasing despite the moratorium on uranium mining, which is only a small fraction of Northern Quebec’s mining activities. As a result of the Plan Nord instituted by Premier Jean Charest, northern mining and industrial development is proceeding more rapidly than ever before, to the detriment of the local ecology and boreal species. Therefore, the temporary moratorium imposed on uranium mining only halted a small niche development in the Quebec mining sector, while far more important and extensive activities continue to expand unchecked. This is why the moratorium on uranium is seen by aboriginals as simply a bandage being applied to a fatal wound, as other mining sectors only increase their presence and impact on their environment.

Ganga River Basin Management Plan, 2015 produced by a consortium of Indian Institutes of Technology propose basin wide planning of the region to preserve and conserve not just the river but its entire basin. 
There are many plans for decentralised management of the river and basin which can ensure better and efficient implementation and also ensure preservation of various livelihoods dependent on the river rather than a top-down, large scale based program. ",The River has been granted legal status as a living entity. ,"In May 2017, Central Government and Uttarakhand State  Government appealed to the Supreme Court against the Uttarakhand High Court decision  regarding granting the right of 'living entity' to the River based on the clause the grant is not implementable and is 'unsustainable in law'.
The Uttarakhand State Government stated that given that the rivers run through different states, it is for the centre to frame policy on protecting them. ""There is no dispute that river Ganga and Yamuna and other tributaries in India... support and assist both life and natural resources and the health and well-being of the entire community. (But) only to protect the faith of society, the rivers cannot be declared as legal persons."" Currently, the order is on stay due to the ongoing legal procedure. 
The Uttarakhand High Court (which has copied, verbatim, some aspects of the New Zealand law), does not mention associated lakes and wetlands. Nor does it explicitly cover the catchment area or other parts of the river basins. The Indian court puts its faith in government officials, namely the Director, NamamiGange, and the Chief Secretary and Advocate General of Uttarakhand. These officials are declared ‘parents’, or “the human face to protect, conserve and preserve” the rivers. But the Indian state has not only failed in maintaining the health of these rivers, it has been complicit in diverting, damming, and polluting them. So how are its officials going to suddenly turn protector?
It is also unclear what does the order mean by 'duty of the river'. And how will the conflict be resolved in case the duty of the river is in contradiction with the right of the river. For example, the river has the right to flow, but if it is stated that the river has the duty to give electricity to the people on the banks, then how will the decision regarding of construction of hydro project be taken is unclear.

The lake is being restored via water transfers, for instance from the Lesser Zab (a transboundary tributary of the Tigris River). Although this is the only option available to restore Lake Urmia, such water transfers produce harmful ecological and socio-economic side effects.

So far, the scheme has proved unsuccessful since most of the Tehran’s residents have not complied with the separation of dry and waste waste [6]. This same view is expressed by activist and sociologist M. Zohoorian but in a more bottom-up setting: “For the separation of garbage, first of all, it must be built up. It should also be remembered that according to the living conditions of the people of the community that reside mostly in small residential units, one can not expect to use only two bins for the separation of waste. If waste separation is done, then the waste bins will be empty and we will no longer see garbage collection” [14]. During the ceremony on the eve of the World Day Against Children's Work in Tehran, Kamil Ahmadi stated that: “Providing citizenship education infrastructure will be another effective way to solve this issue. For example, citizens do not separate their garbage. Part of this problem will be resolved if citizens are held accountable for the separation of waste at home. We make a massive amount of waste without asking ourselves without asking how many of us refuse to get a plastic bag when shopping from a shop? Because our city life has become very lazy”. When it comes to the fact that many wastepickers are illegal Afghan immigrants, Ahmadi mentions that the best solution is to send children under the age of 15 back to Afghanistan and keep children over the age of 15 in Iran. With the help of government agencies they would then be able receive an education [15]. Researcher and civil society activist Murad Saqafi says that these contradictions should be resolved and that simply sending back children to Afghanistan will not solve the problem [15].",Slow increase of the awareness around the problematic of the informal waste sector,"The above deliberations are very preliminary and mainly assume that if the Tehran Waste Management Organization organizes its municipal waste collection services better, there will be less waste for the informal sector to collect - making them magically disappear.

In theory, miners will only be allowed to bring cobalt from the oficial artisanal mining sites and only three research centres will verify the origin of the materials.  However, the miners do not think it is a solution. The artisanal mining is being really limited because multinational corporations buy the land.

Thus the report concludes:
"" The authors of this report call on the UK Government to take decisive action and announce a complete and legally binding coal phase out, as soon as is practically achievable, as well as a removal of support for carbon capture and storage, and an enforced ban on coal mining in the UK. Simultaneously, all support for coal infrastructure abroad should be withdrawn, and the London Stock Exchange effectively regulated to prevent listed companies engaging in harmful activities.

Eight of the Royal Commission’s 67 recommendations focused on prevention and mitigation of electrical causes of future bushfires, including changing Victoria’s Electrical Safety Act 1998 to ensure that companies replace aerial cabling with underground or similar less dangerous apparatus, improve inspection of its assets and take responsibility for clearing surrounding vegetation (VBRC Summary: 29–30).

Rory Walsh who represented the plaintiffs said that ‘the settlement delivers a sense of justice to the victims.’ (Whealing) However, the Department of Human Services almost immediately alerted all potential recipients of relief that in the case of compensation they would be obliged to return all social security payments that they had received (ABC 12 December 2014).

"Local demands according to Wahli were as follows:
- Compensation for all the land, traditional rubber plantations, fruit gardens and other agro-forestry systems damaged and/or taken by the plantation. This should be based on the long-term value of these agro-forestry systems to individual families and the community; in other words, the opportunity costs which local people have suffered by losing these forest resources. It must not be a simple calculation of the value of the timber or one year’s production. (In Bahasa Indonesia they are demanding ganti untung -opportunity costs - rather than ganti rugi – compensation).
Recognition of indigenous land rights. This means that the practice of taking local people’s land without their direct consent must stop. HSL/CDC must not use the local authorities to procure land (at least until democracy at village and district levels is fully implemented under recent local autonomy legislation).
A new agreement must be signed with local communities for the use of their customary (adat) lands over the 25 year period which the plantation permit covers.
Payment of fines determined by customary law for the desecration of graves.
A stop to burning by the company in and around its concession, whether this is to clear land for plantation, to control weeds or to prevent encroachment.
Full transparency about the way the plantation co-operative scheme operates, including its advantages and disadvantages and the financial and other responsibilities of participation. This is essential for local people to be able to make an informed decision about whether to take part.
All people who have given up land and who decide, after being properly informed, that they want to participate in the KKPA scheme must be allocated plots. As far as possible, these should be plots on their own land; agreements must be negotiated where this is not so.
Members of the KKPA scheme must not be burdened with debt. The ‘credit’ system must be abolished.
Even though they realise that there is no chance of going back to their old way of life since their land has been planted with oil palm, some villagers are now demanding their land back. Certain individuals have said that they want a share in the company’s profits proportionate to the land which was taken from them.
Most local people want some kind of guarantee for their future from the company. They want an alternative means of making a living now their forest, agro-forestry gardens and fields have gone. [1]
WAHLI's demands to the company were as follows:
RECOMMENDATIONS
A  	Specific to the HSL/Manis Mata development
Greater transparency about past injustices and a genuine commitment to tackle these. As the major shareholder and manager of the plantation CDC must take responsibility for this and play a leading role. It cannot write past grievances off as history or leave their resolution to its local partner and/or local authorities.
Take a more pro-active role to improving community relations in the future. Setting up new mechanisms for genuine consultation with the local community and conflict resolution should be central to this.
CDC/HSL should commission an independent audit to investigate fully the social, economic and environmental impacts of the plantation. This must be a top-quality investigation – not something done on the cheap to assuage critics – using participatory methods. The terms of reference should be agreed with the indigenous community.
The recommendations of the audit must be discussed openly with the whole community and implemented on a schedule to be agreed with the community.
Set up an appeals procedure to deal with further disputes or disagreements over the settlement of present grievances. The whole community should be made aware of how this operates.
Review the Beringin Jaya KKPA scheme and improve it, drawing on examples of good practice for other KKPA schemes in West/Central Kalimantan.
Accept into the plantation co-operative all people who have given up their land and want to take part. Stakeholdings granted gratuitously to people because of their official positions in the community must be fairly reallocated.
Abolish co-operative stakeholders’ debts through the KKPA. Villagers’ land and labour must be counted as their share in the plantation company.
Set up community development schemes – after full consultation and preparation – to ensure that the whole local community has a means of making a living which is economically, socially, culturally and environmentally sustainable in order to replace the livelihoods which they have lost since the advent of the oil palm plantation.
Respect the land rights of the local community. People who do not want to give up their land or to join the KKPA scheme must not be forced or coerced by any means into this.
Hold full and open discussions about what form the recognition of indigenous land rights should take, in the community’s eyes – whether this means land certification, formal acknowledgement of customary (adat) property law or some other form.
In all these actions, CDC should seek advice from and the active participation of the local community, plus civil society groups which have good grassroots contacts and broad practical experience of the issues important to indigenous communities.","unclear, division within the community","Apparently, local people do not want the plantation to pull out.

"According to Beril Ocaklı (6), one can compare the behaviour of mining companies as follows: ""In the case of the Taldy-Bulak Levoberezhny gold mine in Orlovka, the license-holder has since 2011 been a Chinese one, namely Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. In 2012-2013, following a series of protests by local residents, the Chinese operator endorsed a rather partnership-oriented approach to the community. They signed an agreement with the local administration to ensure investment in social infrastructure, a hiring quota, and environmental monitoring in adherence with the legal framework. After acquiring the social license to operate, however, it became less important to implement the agreement and take the people’s concerns into account. Today, there is no trace of the openness that we saw before the company received Orlovka’s consent. Different segments of society are now working together to access information about the mining plans and to monitor environmental and labor practices. Unfortunately, we do not hear much about the ongoing resistance in Orlovka in the media and public discourse._x000D_
_x000D_
In another example, namely the Shambesai gold concession in the Maidan rural community in Batken, the initial mine developer, Z-Explorer was a subsidiary of Australia-based gold developer Manas Resources. The company discovered gold reserves in 2007 and acquired three licenses to prospect, explore, and develop the deposit from 2005 to 2012—all without the communities’ knowledge. People in Maidan did not know who had licensed 87 hectares of their pasture to whom and why. It was only after violent clashes in October 2013, as they brought in the first excavator to start the construction phase, that the company started to engage with the community, putting a lot of effort into outreach—perhaps more than the Chinese operator in Orlovka did in its quest for a social license. It was, however, already too late for Maidan._x000D_

The Board of the Community Trust to be elected from all stakeholders.
Long term contracts for the exploitation for designated blocks of forest land will be entered into with commercial logging companies who will be contracted to cut and extract logs for sale to millers and processors at prices based on an agreed formula related to regional and world market values.
Long term contracts for the rights to hunt and conduct safari operations in forest areas.
Long term leases for lodges and other tourist related activities.
Agreements on the use of the revenues from these contracts – agreed payments to the Forestry Commission for research and management advice, payments to National Parks for Wildlife management and supervision, payments to the Trust for the purpose of supporting services to the Communities linked to the forests.

Investigación independiente ha señalado que, a pesar de los vacíos legales para regular, acusar e imputar a la ronera por los muchos años de contaminación ambiental, existe una vía legal poco empleada a la que se puede recurrir, y que pasa por los artículos 29 (b) de la Ley 81, y 16 de la Ley 62 (Código Penal). Por ejemplo en la 81 se señala que la evaluación de impacto ambiental es exigible a obras o actividades en curso. Otro ejemplo está en el código penal, que especifica que, aunque no se puede exigir responsabilidad penal a las personas jurídicas estatales, sí se puede en el caso de asociaciones con privados. Este es el caso de la gestión de la Ronera Santa Cruz",,"Han sido décadas de contaminación muy evidente por parte de la ronera, sin que haya recibido ninguna multa, ni pagado impuestos por los vertimientos, ni se haya nunca detenido su producción hasta solucionar el problema socio-ambiental. Esto se debe tanto a los vacíos legales para controlar, señalar e imputar a empresas estatales longevas como estas, como a la propia complicidad de las instituciones del Estado, que se han hecho y se hacen la vista gorda ante la problemática. Como la ronera ya existía previamente al surgimiento del CITMA en 1994 y las legislaciones no incluyen a las industrias que ya existían antes de sus promulgaciones, esta termina siendo ‘no regulable’. Sus operaciones no requieren de licencia ambiental ni pagan impuestos sobre el Vertimiento Aprobado de Residuales en Cuencas Hidrográficas (Ley 113). El país no cuenta con una corte especializada (Tribunales Ambientales) donde ventilar estos temas. En Cuba, para estas industrias “fuera de la ley”, existe una clasificación extraoficial: ‘pasivos ambientales’, entendiéndose estos como una deuda ambiental pasada y pendiente que se debe saldar (económicamente o por vía de rehabilitación), aunque en realidad estas empresas siguen contaminando en el presente. Esto en el caso cubano es significativo si se toma en cuenta que la mayor parte de la industria nacional se puso en operación antes de la caída del Campo Socialista (como los centrales azucareros del país). No obstante, es esencial  insistir en el segundo factor mencionado: las instituciones del Estado cubano han tenido una notoria inacción ante el caso, y no se puede decir que sea por desconocimiento (pues hay ya bastante evidencia de su conciencia sobre el problema). A esto hay que sumarle la nula atención que se le ha brindado a los integrantes de las comunidades y pescadores que han denunciado los efectos negativos de la contaminación, y que no ven que las autoridades asuman las tareas para remediarlo o al menos frenarlo.

"Pollution victims in Osaka’s Nishiyodogawa Ward ... have drawn illustration-style maps that show their proposed redevelopment plans for the kind of places they would like to live. Their ideas include streamside footpaths, neighborhood vegetable plots, boats ferrying rivers, lively shopping districts, and others that take advantage of regional characteristics. People who have lived in these neighborhoods many years while suffering from illnesses add to these ideas their feelings of attachment to the neighborhoods, and the hope that the children of the next generation will be healthy.
The initiative of the Nishiyodogawa Association for Pollution Patients and Their Families is a pioneering effort among these community development activities. The Association created the “Nishiyodogawa Redevelopment Plan,” which seeks cooperation in community development from the companies that were defendants in the Nishiyodogawa Pollution Lawsuit, and on six occasions since 1991 area residents, the companies, and the local government have tendered proposals for a relationship under which all can cooperate.
In March 1995 plaintiffs reached an agreement with the companies in the Nishiyodogawa Pollution Lawsuit, and in September 1996 part of the monetary settlement was used to establish a foundation called the Center for the Redevelopment of Pollution-damaged Areas in Japan (Aozora Foundation), whose job is to actualize redevelopment plans.",,"Justice had to wait too long, and compensation payments were small.

As reported in The Japan Times (July 1998) the settlement calls for specific measures to improve air quality, effectively showing the state’s partial responsibility for the pollution, observers said. The agreement ended a 20-year legal battle in which the plaintiffs sought damages for health problems caused by the exhaust fumes from vehicles and smokestacks in Nishi-Yodogawa Ward. The plaintiffs — sworn victims of illnesses caused by factory and auto emissions or victims’ surviving relatives — filed the four cases over a span of 14 years, demanding compensation for respiratory ailments. Companies also sued in the litigation reached a compromise in March 1995 to pay about 4 billion yen in damages. 
Specific antipollution measures outlined in the settlement include easing traffic on the expressway in Nishi-Yodogawa Ward by reducing the number of lanes, removing nitrogen oxides from auto emissions and implementing highway air pollution tests.

The committees have proposed measures that would reduce waste production (principally by reducing it upstream). In addition, proposals have been drawn up for an integrated waste cycle that is based on a sorted waste collection door-to-door, on the composting of the organic fraction and on the use of alternative technologies to incineration for the remaining part (as the Mechanical biological Treatment, the molecular dissociator and the system THOR). 
The committees have embraced (as indeed all the environmental movements of the region) the Zero Waste strategy as a guide for the correct approach to the problem of waste. This approach involves, in addition to reducing, reusing and recycling, the involvement of the industrial sector for the prevention of waste, the eco-design of products and the extended producer responsibility.",,"The massive use of police by the government imposed the opening of the landfill. However, the reasons of the committees have been confirmed by investigations of the judiciary, and the landfill was closed.

"As published in a position paper by Save Sierra Madre Network Alliance (SSMNA) [6], the large coalition of Civil Society Organizations proposes the following:
“Save Sierra Madre Network Alliance (SSMNA), in its advocacy against mega-dams, recommends, first and foremost, a genuine comprehensive, participative and corrupt-free program for the restoration of our watersheds and forests. The Alliance sees the National Greening Program of the present Administration as a false solution, not to mention, as just another venue for the rampant corruption within the DENR. Together with this, SSMNA also pushes the passing into law of the Forest Resources Bill which prioritizes the protection of our remaining forests. Budget for forest protection must also be increased. Any reforestation program would be irrelevant if forest protection, which should include genuine logging moratorium as well as mining moratorium, is not seriously prioritized. 
SSMNA also strongly recommends uncorrupted repairs and improvements of the already existing dams, including the entire water pipe system. Of the 4,000 MLD capacity of Angat Dam, around 1600 MLD has been recorded as Maynilad and Manila Water’s combined “non-revenue” water or NRW (water leakages). When Maynilad and Manila Water took over our water system, they promised to lower the NRW to 32% by 2007. Has this promise been fulfilled? If the present non-revenue water would be reduced, we would have more water supply. 
SSMNA also sees the need for a water conservation policy which would check the lifestyle of all consumers, exhorting them to responsible consumption and conservation of water. Water recycling and rainwater harvesting could also be considered in the formulation and promulgation of such a policy.”",,"The affected communities have successfully resisted for over 30 years, which can be seen as a success in environmental justice.

"The biggest alternative being proposed is green harvesting. The Sierra Club's ""Stop the Burn Campaign"" is a huge advocate of green harvesting replacing pre-harvest burns. Green harvesting has become a predominant practice around the world [1]. Brazil, Australia, Cuba, and Zimbabwe all used to rely on pre-harvest burns to harvest sugarcane but they have successfully switched over to green harvesting. This has created a very profitable market for sugarcane trash [1]. If the US sugar industry continues to use outdated practices they are missing out on profitable opportunities. The demand for organic sugar cane and clean renewable biomass energy (such as sugarcane ethanol, biodiesel, and biochar) will only continue to grow [1]. Green harvesting is presenting Big Sugar to “create new green jobs and contribute to a new era of prosperity for the Glades” [1].  _x000D_
Many other environmental organizations, including the Everglades Coalition, propose a 27-30 mile buffer around the impacted communities, which includes South Bay, Belle Glade, and Pahokee.

Even amid COVID-19, the 2020-2021 harvest season is proceeding, furthering the endangerment of the western Palm Beach residents. While there the class-action lawsuit is in process, this case exemplifies the power a well-established industry has. The sugar industry generously contributes to elected officials and candidates in public office, as well as funding pervasive lobbying operations, making it difficult to hold them responsible and accountable [12].  In October 2019, Commissioner Fried announced what “ she said were the first major changes to sugarcane burning regulations in nearly three decades” [3]. In August 2020, Fried announced the second phase intends to implement a training program for burners and revise the zones set up in the 1990s [3].  The changes are targeted to “reduce [the] potential smoke impact to all communities” and the revisions are planning to take effect in January 2021 [3]. However, the Sierra Club argues the changes do not fully protect the Florida residents living in the Glades [3]. Fried and the FDACS continue to drag their feet about holding the sugar industry accountable and keeping the residents in western Palm Beach County and the surrounding Glades area safe [3].

"Developing a set of alternatives to this phytosanitary emergency is and continues to be a matter of discord.
This process revolves around two main different views on how to deal and live with the bacterium Xylella Fastidiosa.
The first alternative is proposed by a large part of the scientific expertise and backed by some of the agricultural entrepreneurs. In their view, the only suitable option, for the moment, is to concentrate on the research for resistant/tolerant cultivars. It has been noted that some cultivars like ""Leccino"" and ""Fs17"" (also known as ""Favolosa"") demonstrated a resistance to the bacterium, therefore reducing the possibility for the plant to show symptoms of decline. 
Local Social Movements strongly oppose this alternative, besides underlying the possibility for price speculations on these new resistant cultivars, Social Movements complain that nothing has been done in order to find a ""cure"" for the diseased tree. 
Movements propose what they define as the ""360°Approach"", an approach that does not look exclusively at the pathogen, but to the entire plant system, highlighting the importance of researching on alternative or contributory causes (i.e. fungi, soil pollution, and overuse of agro-chemical products) with the ultimate goal of curing olive orchards instead of eradicating them or replace them with other cultivars.
In this regard, in addition to advocating for “good farming practices”, movements also support various remedies such copper and zinc-based bio-fertilizers, the use of inoculum of endo- and/or ecto-mycorrhizae and beneficial fungi and bacteria (to restore the soil microbiota), and a wide range of ecologically sustainable techniques which, according to them, represent a necessary alternative to pursue in order to find a solution to this plant disease.",,The controversy goes on. ,No,In operation,the-olive-quick-decline-syndrome-in-apulia,5.0,#ee2c2c,

"A proposal brought about for combating this project is an inspection of the City’s 600,000 linear feet of sewers. This would determine what portions need to be fixed, and even if the entire system needs to be replaced. Surprisingly, the City of Mount Vernon has already started this process, inspecting 10,000 linear feet of sewers. While a promising start, the advancements on the project have since halted and no real change has been initiated. In order for the remaining 590,000 linear feet of sewer lines to be inspected in an 18 to 24 month span, the City would need to invest in a qualified crew and new equipment. The cost of a Department of Public Works crew of four people and new equipment would cost the city a total of $850,000 USD. Investments into both a Commissioner of Community Planning and Development as well as a City Engineer will also be necessary. The neighboring cities of New Rochelle and Yonkers each pay these positions upwards of $100,000 annually. The estimated cost of the remaining portion of sewer left to inspect as well as positions that need to be filled is about $1,836,000. However, after subtracting grants as well as vacancy savings, the net total cost of this project would be $122,000 [10].

The trade is illegal, whether viewed in terms of the law of pillage under the Fourth Geneva Convention of the right of the Saharawi people under the UN General Assembly Resolution 1803 to permanent sovereignty over their resources.¨ The Moroccan government adopts the view that Western Sahara is an integral part of the Moroccan territory, a view which has been reinforced by the stalled referendum process and weak international response to the dispute.",,"The ongoing conflict and European Union resolutions forbidding trading in Western Sahara has prevented prolonged partnership with European trading partners, on most cases. Legislation creating a moratorium on trade with Western Sahara includes: a Sept 13 2016 legal decision declared by the lawyers of the European Union´s Tribunal that stipulated that Morocco has no sovereignty on Western Sahara and in consequence the commercial agreements between the European Union and Morocco are not applicable in Western Sahara. However, despite this legislation, as the price of phosphorus fluctuates, companies continue to purchase from the OCP. October 2016, the Authority of Petroleum and Mining of the SADR denounced Lithuanian company Lifosa´s continued exploitation of phosphorus in the country. The exiled government of SADR issued a complaint from its exiled capital in Algeria protesting Lifosa´s continuing exploitation of phosphorous, which included a shipment of 75,000 tons of phosphate rock delivered to Lithuania from a port in Western Sahara. Furthermore, violence continues between Moroccan and Polisario forces. In August of 2016, Moroccan military forces invaded Gar-Garat, an important commercial center in southern Polisario-controlled region of Western Sahara where Mauritanian, Sahrawi, and Moroccan traders exchange goods. Bulldozers have begun construction of fortifications, evidence that the military units plan to stay for an extended period in the zone. Most recently, in September 2016, the Polisario demanded that the UN Security Council prevent the occupying powers of the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara from building a paved road through Saharawi territory to merge with the border of Mauritania.",No,In operation,resource-extraction-in-boucra-western-sahara-updated-by-julie-snorek-7-nov-2016,5.0,#ee2c2c,

A solution has been proposed in 2010 by a local politician for choosing an alternative site of the regional landfill at the so called blind spots of Maritza Iztok where coal mines had been in exploitation. ,,"In 2010 the EIA decision was challenged by the Initiative Committee of the villagers of Rakitnitsa. They soon realized that their statements have not been taken into account. Other wrongdoings emerged to the surface after it became clear that there was no detailed development plan and the location did not correspond to the area of the landfill. The official complaint letter against the construction of a regional landfill site near Rakitnitsa was first approved by Regional Administrative Court but later it was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria.
In a letter filed to the EU Parliaments Petition Committee the chairmen of the Initiative Committee insist that state and municipality unite their efforts to adequately and legally solve the problem in compliance with Bulgarian and European legislation on waste management and respecting the principles of transparency and public participation. His statement was supported by the chief of the Ecological inspection of Stara Zagora, who (possibly not by chance) failed to become the next director of REIW Stara Zagora.

While compensation may be awarded to plaintiffs in court, there is currently no alternative solution that can reverse the effects of the coal ash spill on the lives, property, and well-being of those affected. ",,"While there were some positive things that came out of the clean-up and litigation, overall, environmental justice was not served. Many of the property-related plaintiffs’ saw their claims denied by the district court and the compensation awarded to them was both inadequate and excluded consideration of their chronic health issues. After more than a decade, cleanup workers and their families have yet to have their substantive claims adjudicated and it is possible that the Tennessee Supreme Court will find that state law bars many, if not all, of the workers’ claims. Further, Tennessee has a tort claims statute which caps the financial recovery for personal injury, pain and suffering; these caps are likely below the medical costs already incurred by the workers and will not begin to cover the lifetime medical costs incurred by them and their families to monitor and treat their conditions. More fundamentally, over 50 cleanup workers have died since being exposed to the toxic coal ash [14]. No amount of financial compensation or policy changes will be sufficient justice for them and their families. More broadly, the TVA spent an estimated $1.2 billion to clean up the spill and turn the area into a public park, but significant contamination of water resources remains [28]. The EPA finalized rulemaking in 2015 that imposed national requirements for new coal ash landfills and surface impoundments, including mandatory groundwater monitoring with publicly available results, and improved requirements to ensure the structural integrity of the containment ponds, but existing facilities are not covered by the rule [28].",No,In operation,kingston-fossil-plant-harriman-tn,5.0,#ee2c2c,

"MANIFEST  D'ANTELLA  “NO A LA VENDA D’AIGUA DEL XÚQUER CAP ALMERIA”. Maig 2022. _x000D_
_x000D_
 El riu Xúquer ha sigut sempre el riu valencià per excel·lència. Durant molts segles, ha sigut un vertader riu, orgullós i colèric, però també lleial, com són els nostres rius. Ha alimentat una agricultura llegendària de tarongerars, hortes i arrossars. Ha mantingut l’Albufera sana i plena de vida, i ha arribat a Cullera net, fertilitzant la mar i renovant l’arena de les platges._x000D_
Però ara el Xúquer és un riu sobreexplotat, al que li han pegat tants mossos en els últims anys que va aproximant-se a la seua mort, sense que les administracions responsables facen res per impedir-ho, sinó tot el contrari, propiciant noves agressions._x000D_
_x000D_
Fa pocs anys volgueren donar-li el colp de gràcia al Xúquer mitjançant un transvasament al Vinalopó des de Cortes de Pallàs per endur-se tots els anys 80 hm3. La reacció decidida de la societat valenciana i de la comarca de la Ribera va canviar el punt de presa d’aigua al final del riu, a l’assut de la Marquesa, i va condicionar que els transvasaments foren a sobrants del riu, encara que ara, aprofitant la proposta de la Sèquia Reial, volen aigua per al Vinalopó des d’Alarcón, a 300 km de la desembocadura. No anem a consentir-lo. Estarem atents._x000D_
_x000D_
Recentment hem pogut conèixer que es vol posar en marxa una operació de cessió de drets d’ús d’aigua de la Séquia Reial del Xúquer en favor de la societat Aguas de Almeria, S.A. Segons la premsa es tractaria d’enviar 10 hm3 anuals durant 5 anys. Un total de 50 hm3, el que és un transvasament en tota regla._x000D_
_x000D_
 Aquesta venda d’aigua es planteja en una situació de sobreexplotació del Xúquer. Segons el Pla Hidrològic, el sistema Xúquer té en l’actualitat un dèficit de 250 hm3/any per atendre drets d’aigua legalment reconeguts. I el mateix pla afegeix que com a conseqüència de la disminució de recursos derivats del CC el dèficit serà superior a 300 hm3/any._x000D_
_x000D_
El Pla Hidrològic ha agreujat encara més la sobreexplotació de l’aqüífer de la Manxa Oriental, que és la principal responsable del declivi del Xúquer en les últimes dècades. La Confederació ha optat per mantindre i ampliar les assignacions que superen la recàrrega natural de l’aqüífer._x000D_
_x000D_
Per altra banda els cabals ecològics per al Xúquer són insuficients, ja que les modificacions proposades no arriben a compensar la pèrdua de cabals provocats per la modernització de regadius. Especialment preocupant és la situació del cabal en els trams d’Antella, Sueca, Cullera i la desembocadura._x000D_
_x000D_

"The coastal road project in La Réunion has been controversial and has faced several challenges, including legal and environmental issues. The following are some of the potential outcomes that had arisen or could arise from the project._x000D_
_x000D_
Environmental improvement : If the project were to go ahead, it could potentially lead to some environmental improvements, such as the creation of new habitats for marine life or the establishment of protected areas. The project could undergo a new environmental impact assessment, either as part of a legal challenge or in response to concerns raised by environmental groups or local communities. But the current result shows rather a destruction of the biodiversity of the island. The previous study by the National Council for the Protection of Nature (CNPN), dated 2018, already reported “proven negative impacts, inadequacies in consideration and uncertainties regarding the environmental impacts of the NRL project.” [9] The region is already suggesting that it will not implement certain environmental compensation measures such as the dismantling of the current coastal road valued at €50 million._x000D_
_x000D_
Application of existing regulations : In the case of the coastal road project in La Réunion, the application of existing regulation could potentially play a significant role in the outcome of the project. As with most infrastructure projects, the construction of the coastal road would be subject to a range of local, national, and international regulations and environmental laws. In France, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are required for most major development projects, including infrastructure projects. The EIA process involves an evaluation of the potential environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed project, as well as the identification of potential measures to mitigate or offset these impacts. If the coastal road project is found to be in violation of these regulations, it could be subject to legal action and potentially face penalties or fines. On the other hand, if the project is found to be in compliance with existing regulations and environmental laws, it could proceed, although there may still be opposition from environmental groups or local communities who feel that the project poses a significant risk to the island's fragile ecosystem. However compliance with regulations and environmental laws does not necessarily mean that a project will not have negative impacts on the environment or on local communities. The EIAs themselves are often criticized for not adequately taking into account the cumulative impacts of multiple development projects, or for being overly influenced by the interests of project proponents. As a result, compliance with regulations and environmental laws is not a guarantee that the project will be sustainable or environmentally responsible._x000D_
_x000D_
Negotiated alternative solution: It is possible that stakeholders could agree to an alternative solution that addresses the concerns of all parties, such as a modified version of the coastal road or an alternative transportation plan. In the case of the coastal road project in La Réunion, there have been proposals by environmental justice organizations and other stakeholders for alternative approaches to transportation infrastructure that could mitigate the impacts of the proposed road. For example, some groups have advocated for the development of public transportation systems, such as light rail or bus rapid transit, that would reduce the need for individual vehicles and alleviate traffic congestion. Other proposals have included investment in renewable energy technologies, which could reduce the island's dependence on fossil fuels and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenpeace, for instance, has called for the implementation of sustainable and low-carbon transportation systems that prioritize public transportation and non-motorized transportation options, such as walking and cycling. Greenpeace has also called for the implementation of renewable energy solutions, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels. While the development of alternatives may face challenges, such as funding and political opposition, they represent an opportunity to shift away from traditional approaches to transportation infrastructure development and towards more sustainable and environmentally responsible solutions.

These agreements seek protection of indigenous sacred sites and burials; unimpeded access to the mauka (mountain) and makai (ocean) cultural and subsistence resources; establishment of community-based indigenous organizations and job training for local people; and support of Hawaiian cultural and environmental restoration programs. In 1989 the Hawai'i Ecumenical Coalition issued ""The Hawai'i Declaration on Tourism."" This declaration stressed that a state of emergency existed for Hawaiian people and for the fragile island environment. It emphasized that tourism did not benefit the poor and the native Hawaiians; that tourism was a new form of exploitation; and that it was not an indigenous practice. The proposed rectifying actions included: return of the lands held in fiduciary trust by the state to the Native Hawaiian people; an immediate ban on further resort development in rural communities; and assistance to foster a community-based economy as an alternative to tourism (www.culturalsurvival.org).
The temporary downturn of international tourism and the devastation caused by hurricane Iwa on Kaua'i in 1993 encouraged a brief dialogue among tourist officials and Hawaiian grassroots groups to explore the rebuilding of the visitors industry from a community perspective. The proposed plan by Hui Ho `Okipa O Kaua'i called for the establishment of Hawaiian community development corporations and Hawaiian cultural centers. In 1993 the Hawai'i Ecumenical Coalition issued a one page flyer on ""Responsible Tourism,"" proposing ""A Hawaiian Point of View"" on tourism. This statement indicated that mass tourism and commercialization must give way to a more sensible recognition of the dignity and the needs of the Hawaiian people. This requires respecting the Hawaiian culture and the Hawaiian Islands, and promoting more ethical business practices. Tourists should have better opportunities to learn about Hawaiian people. Exploitation should be avoided by the industry and investments should be made to improve the conditions of Hawaiians (www.culturalsurvival.org).

There are differing voices in the debate on natural resource extraction in Greenland, creating what Hansen et al. (2013) have described as environmental and ethical dilemmas [16]. Many business leaders, politicians and Greenlanders view natural resource extraction and mining activities as a means to boost economic activity and create employment [38]. With more and more young people emigrating from the island in search of further education or employment and Greenland seeking greater financial independence from Denmark, mineral exploitation is regarded as a way to help mitigate these issues and this has become one of the dominant if not the most dominant discourse around mining [2, 17]. The Greenlandic government is therefore actively encouraging new large-scale mining projects [3], of which the Kuannersuit REE-Uranium project has become one of the most divisive mining projects in Greenland to date. However, the ability to gain financial independence from Denmark on the basis of mining has also been questioned given the size of Danish subsidies, emphasising the continued importance of the fishing, hunting and agricultural industries [39]. In Narsaq, the town is experiencing increased emigration, and there is a general consensus from residents both opposing and supporting the project that something needs to change in order for the town to ‘survive’ [16, 17]. With both support and opposition existing among locals living close to the proposed project site in Narsaq [16], it is therefore difficult to evaluate what outcome would be considered a success for the community. One survey conducted by WWF found that 53% of survey participants from the Southern Greenland region supported uranium mining in general [29]. However, on the basis of one survey referring to uranium mining generally and not specifically interviewing local residents, these results cannot be held equivalent to opinions on the Kuannersuit project. Many local residents of Narsaq and nearby areas have mobilised against the project in demonstrations and signed petitions faced with the risk of nuclear pollution (see account of mobilisations above). It is important to note that local residents opposing the Kuannersuit project are not necessarily against mining in general, as the debate around Kuannersuit is highly focused on the question of uranium [16]. However, central to the debate around the controversial project has been the question of whether public consultation has been adequate [26, 27]. The view that public consultation needs to be improved in the environmental and social impact assessments is shared by local residents in Narsaq and nearby Qaqortoq both in favour and opposed to the project [16]. The lack of appropriate public consultation and engagement is a clear issue of procedural injustice and improvements are being demanded by local populations not only in the Kuannersuit project but also in other mining projects across the country [16, 18, 26, 38]. The short public consultation period and bias of information sessions regarding the project as well as the lack of transparency on issues of compensation are amongst some of the issues that are being raised. Furthermore, fieldwork conducted by Hansen and Johnstone (2019) in southern Greenland shows how some local residents in Narsaq felt that the debate around the Kuannersuit project was being directed by strong external actors and polarised between international environmental NGOs on the one side and the mining company on the other [16]. Interviews with local residents conducted by Bjørst (2016) also pointed to two dominant discourses around this project; on the one hand the mining sector ‘saving’ the community (creating jobs etc.) and benefiting Greenlandic economy, and on the other NGOs arguing that the project will ‘destroy’ the community and environment [17]. They consequently felt marginalised in these competing agendas, which points to serious limitations in procedural justice. In addition to this, there have been calls from environmental organisations and the Greenlandic party IA to hold a referendum on uranium mining, but so far these have not been met [28]. Altogether, these issues indicate serious EJ concerns and point to the project so far being an EJ defeat. _x000D_

Second, the widespread degradation of the ecology of the Ganga River has aggravated fishery conflicts to extreme levels – where an exodus from fisheries is being witnessed, and fishers appear to have the feeling that they have ‘lost the battle’.
A combined result is that there is still poor mobilization of fishing communities (see Jassal 2001 for a crucial example), to challenge injustices and inequalities that they face regularly. Third, while the role of social movements and civil society organizations in bringing the conflict issues to the fore has been laudable, the effort appears to have hit only roadblocks whenever the state government departments have been involved in action – this especially includes the Fisheries and Forest Departments.

Mahalaxmi race course was handed over to the MMRDA to be used for the metro car shed but they chose to withdraw from the mahalaxmi car shed for reasons best known to them and they came to aarey. The reason given by the MMRCA was that the race course had a heritage structure on it. The heritage structure is a spectators stand which is a grade three heritage structure. Horse racing has stopped and there is enough open land next to it. Yet, they did not use it. The lease for the horse racing has expired and the land is available to the government. And the basic fact remains that this land was given to them and they chose to walk out of it.
Fourth Option is BKC. MMRCL refused point blank to consider it saying that it is high real estate. This must be the only country in the world where a land with 4000 trees on it next to river is less precious than a land that has no trees on it. The land at BKC is barren – there are no trees on it and most importantly it is in the custody of MMRDA.
Fifth option was kalina university. Kalina university has enough land which is lying unused since the past two decades. It has been encroached by slums and there are vested interests at play that are trying to grab that land. Interestingly, this land was also sought and accepted as an option in the project report. Now kalina – they are saying that the land is not sufficient. There is more than 25 hectares of land available at kalina.
Sixth option is dharavi. It’s a huge slum – massive property which has to be eventually redeveloped – all alum dwellers need to be re settled. They cant be living in filth all their lives – it has been part of the government’s plan for many years now. Moving the slum dwellers and locating the car shed there would benefit everyone.
Seventh option There is enough land inside SEEPZ, inside the MIDC for this car shed. Its very visible – they have not considered that.
Eighth Option Now the most viable and most available land is the kanjurmarg dumping grounds. Kanjurmarg is an abandoned salt pan which does not receive any tide water for the last 15 years. The land is barren hard and it is available.
Kanjurmarg has more than 250 acres of land – enough to accommodate a metro shed and a complete transport hub. They said that there is a litigation going on this land. If kanjurmarg was not suitable, why did the Maharashtra state government go to the Bombay high court and file a petition that this land was suitable for construction and since aarey was an ecosensitive zone, the court should grant permission to build a metro shed there?
They filed this petition in 2016. MMRCL has made no effort to even mention this matter in the court or even pursue it. They did not follow up the case and the case if lying there. There is land in kanjurmarg for 10 metro sheds, not one and it is still available and it is possible",The conflict is ongoing.

However, the developments to date point to clear EJ limitations. The Inuit Circumpolar Council are amongst those who have criticised the lack of debate over mining development in Greenland, as Naalakkersuisut quickly opened up to foreign mining companies and investment upon gaining self-rule, marginalising the consultation on large-scale projects such as Isua [24]. Local consultation in the mining process has arguably been made more difficult following a structural shift in the municipalities of Greenland in 2009, where the decision was made to join 18 municipalities into four large ones spanning over huge geographical areas [5]. In the Isua case, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and Avataq have both argued for an improved public consultation process. The lack of appropriate public consultation therefore points to serious procedural justice issues with the Isua project and indicate it so far having EJ limitations. Another EJ issue in this case is the dilemma resulting from differing ideas of ownership rights over land and resources in Greenland. People mobilising against the project and EJ organisations have pointed to the contradictions between the collective land use in the area of the proposed Isua mine as a traditional hunting area, and the exclusive exploitation rights granted to private mining companies by the government [3]. However, with an overall pro-mining stance in Greenland at the prospect of economic prosperity and jobs, evaluating what outcome would be considered a success for the community is difficult. Results from past public hearings have pointed to the Isua mine being an opportunity for both direct and indirect employment and development of local businesses, alongside education and training opportunities [5]. However, with the controversial ‘Large Scale Project Act’ (‘Storskalaloven’) easing the ability to bring international labour to work on large-scale projects, the beneficial social impacts on the local community are not certain to become a reality [6]._x000D_

"KCC is currently involved in numerous activities centered around livelihood generation and sustainable ecotourism, such as:  
-	Village homestays 
With the aim of encouraging sustainable tourism facilities and creating opportunities for the villagers to earn economic benefits, KCC started promoting Village Homestays. Along with offering services which are efficient and environmental friendly services such as fuel-efficient cooking and heating, and hygienic indigenous composting toilets (Chettri et al, 2008), the homestay practice also encourages cultural and environmental conservation by providing an opportunity to strengthen the local culture and tradition in terms of hospitality, use of decor, cuisine, and buildings (Chettri et al, 2008) and enables cultural exchange between the villagers and the outsiders. 
As of 2017, KCC has helped train around 400 homestay operators by selecting lower income family members who can benefit from additional income and women for whom financial empowerment would be valuable. KCC handles all of the marketing and booking requirements and also provides a range of hospitality-based training for homestay owners. For example, homestay owners are given the opportunity to participate in cooking, housekeeping and financial management training. 
 An important contribution of KCC’s work has been the establishment of a minimum room tariff for homestays. This emerged from fears of potential exploitation of homestay owners who were arm-twisted into lowering their room tariffs to unsustainable levels. This occurred more so because of competition from large hotels and resorts. Through KCC’s facilitation, all homestay owners now request a nightly tariff of Rs 2500.
-	 Zero Waste Trekking  
KCC formed a participatory monitoring programme of the trekking trail inside KNP and in the surrounding areas. KCC identified and invited key local people and national park staff from the village for a general consultation meeting. The goals of the monitoring process were discussed and with consultation of the village member’s consensus was arrived at about participating in the proposed programme. Consultation and assistance from external agencies such as the Forest department and Sikkim tourism department were sought to make an effective work plan that would address the issues of monitoring tourism activities and conservation impacts. Having set their targets, several meetings were conducted in the village to make local people and those involved in tourism enterprises aware as to why such an initiative was important and how local people could participate and contribute. 
Objectives of the monitoring programme:
 1. Monitoring the status of waste, condition of trekking trails and campsite facilities over the trekking routes 
2. Monitoring the prohibition of use of firewood and other forest products by trekkers, trek operators and their support staff 
3. Involve tourists, trekkers and local tourism operators in the monitoring process
Annually, the monitoring programs helps in collection of around 800 kg of waste from the trekking trails and the forests. KCC now operates a functional Waste Segregation Centre and has worked with the Forest Department to create a system by which trekking operators have to declare non bio-degradable waste products through that are being carried through a checklist and upon return account for these products. Defaulters are fined a hefty sum of Rs.5000 if they fail to account for waste that was not brought back.
Waste material like noodle packets, tetra packs, plastic etc. are recycled to make fashionable handbags, pillows, notebooks and so on that tourists can buy when the visit the KCC office. Yuksam was the first village in Sikkim to ban the use of plastic (both bags and bottles) in 1996 and the Government of Sikkim has since implemented this throughout the state. KCC also implemented and encouraged trekking companies to adopt a prohibition on the use of firewood during treks. Currently, all trekking groups are required to carry kerosene stoves (also monitored pre and post trek).  
Connected to low-impact trekking trails is the introduction and widespread use of dzos instead of yaks, which is a move that KCC strongly encouraged in the 1990s. This came out of numerous surveys that showed the adverse grazing impacts of yaks as compared to dzos (a hybrid between yaks and domestic cows).
-	 Ecotourism Service Providers Association of Yuksam (ESPAY) 
ESPAY (Ecotourism Service Providers Association of Yuksam) is an association that KCC initiated in 2004 to provide capacity building to trekking guides, dzo and yak owners, porters and other ecotourism-related professionals in Yuksom. As of 2017, KCC has trained more than 100 cooks through various training programs, around 250 naturalists guides, around 1000 porters and pack animal operators. ESPAY currently has 250 members has a range of different activities including: (a) lobbying at the state level for minimum living wages for porters and (b) community compensation scheme for loss of dzos due to trekking accidents and natural causes; and (c) provision of vaccinations and veterinary support for livestock
-	Environmental Education Activities
The KCC office is also an environmental education centre that tourists are encouraged to visit to learn about KNP and low-impact tourism. In 2005-6, KCC trained around 100 teachers on Environmental Education. From information about the wildlife that trekkers can encounter on trails to recycled trekking waste, the KCC centre remains accessible for all visitors to the area. However, given that visiting the Centre isn’t mandatory for trekkers, bringing in all visitors continues to be a challenge",,"Challenges remain: 
Key challenge concerning urbanisation and sustainable development has been to come to village-level agreements. While KCC has been able to achieve a lot by engaging with individual homestay owners or dzo owners, bringing the village together to discuss issues continues to be a challenge. For example, trekking by itself is now zero-waste. However, commercial development in Yuksam town itself in the form of large hotels and allied facilities is not regularized. The Gram Sabha had at one point agreed to restrict infrastructure development to buildings of three floors only. However, it has been difficult to enforce this without a formal Gram Sabha resolution. Finally, with regards to the Waste Segregation Centre, while all trekking-related waste is being collected at a designated Centre, it has been challenging to find ways to recycle all of this waste material. KCC has managed to create some recycled products from this waste but a large amount of waste material remains at the Centre with no clear channels for what happens next.
Enforcing and monitoring stringent trekking regulations has been challenging because of varying support from the Forest Department. Primarily, trekking occurs inside KNP and therefore, strictly enforcing regulations on collection of wildlife species and forest products and fuelwood use is still largely within the jurisdiction of the Departments’ core activities. While KCC can push the Department to carry out patrolling and monitoring activities, these decisions are beyond the scope of KCC’s influence.",Not sure,In operation,khangchendzonga-conservation-committee,5.0,#ee2c2c,

In the short term, the government took on a range of measures, including an extensive legal enforcement campaign in the spring following the spill. [...] In 2002 Beijing began to establish Regional Supervision Centers (RSCs) that answered directly to SEPA instead of local governments. Following the Songhua incident, the process of establishing the local EPBs was further expedited and prioritized, and both ADB and the World Bank are currently involved in projects helping the establishment of additional RSCs. At present the RSCs, which include a major center in Chongqing, have met with limited success, but they represent an important step towards a clear chain of accountability in the process of environmental protection, which in itself promotes government transparency.

"The Meinung People's Association was established by a group of farmers, local political leaders, youth who had returned home, and local artists. The group organized meetings in opposition to the reservoir, and through a series of lectures and publicity events, gradually created a mood of local opposition to the plans.

The Meinong People's Association stated that opposition to the reservoir was only a start, and that the movement would continue into the future. 
Following a number of initiatives over the years, a movement that started in opposition to a single reservoir has grown into a broader water conservation movement.

"Prof. Stefan Bouzarovski of the University of Manchester in cooperation with Macedonian NGO Ekosvest has created a SMART Ohrid concept vision as an alternative to the proposed national park express road. It intends to reduce traffic volume with provision of green public transport and toll zones for cars.
Alternatives to the construction of a ski-resort and lakeshore infrastructure for mass tourism focus on nature, culture, adventure, archaeology, geology and ecological tourism as higher value, lower impact options. The Ohrid-Prespa region demonstrates firm potential in these sectors due to its UNESCO status for both culture and nature; specific geological composition;  ecological bounty; long history as one of the earliest inhabited regions of Europe; and dramatic scenery. 
Instead of draining Lake Ohrid's last wetlands, placing them at the center of an archaeo-ecological attraction has been suggested. This would involve the development of a visitor center to explore the Galapagos-like ecosystems of the region incorporating three diverse yet related features: an area of pre-Christian water worship at the site of a Byzantium church; an unique karstic spring; and the Studenchishte Marsh wetlands that are so vital to the ongoing ecological integrity of Lake Ohrid.
In addition, further encouragement of scientific research is also necessary both to access the wealth of knowledge locked within Ohrid-Prespa ecosystems and to diversify the regional economy.  ","Activists have come under pressure from authorities to discontinue their support for environmentally sustainable solutions. One has been criminally charged, but the charges were later dropped upon a series of police interviews; another received warning at work; a third was advised by members of the ruling party to desist.

"The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on the governments in ship-owning countries (in particular: the EU and its Member States, Japan, China, Singapore, and the US) to prohibit the export of end-of-life vessels to South Asian shipbreaking countries as long as:
- end-of-life vessels contain significant amounts of hazardous waste;
- the shipbreaking countries cannot prove that all hazardous waste is removed, store, treated, disposed or destructed in a fully clean and safe way;
- working and living conditions of shipbreaking workers remain inadequate;
- shipbreaking does not take place in modern ship recycling facilities off the beach with minimum technical and infrastructural requirements allowing for the containment of pollutions and workers’ health and safety.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on ship owner, to only sell the end-of-life vessels to modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. In mid-2015, the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards, which responsible ship owners can use.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform its member organisations in Bangladesh recommend the following actions to the Government of India, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:
- The Government needs to close down all shipbreaking yards which do not operate in full accordance with the Supreme Court rulings and exisiting rules and regulations.
- The Government must ensure that yard owners are held responsible for severe injures and deaths resulting from a lack of adequate infrastructe, equipment, oversight or training. So far, no yard owner has been held responsible for malpractice or negligence.
- The Government together with the relevant local authorities should develop and implement a «Green Ship Recycling Strategy», that is a cross-departmental policy to allow for the much needed change towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO.
- The Government should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure to develop modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. 
- The «Green Ship Recycling Strategy» should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).
- The Government should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia – Bangladesh and Pakistan – in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a ‘level playing field’ is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.
- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Supreme Court rulings and obligations under international law, the Government needs to develop the sector-specific shipbreaking rules. The regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between different government agencies at the national and local level and needs to clearly define the competent authorities’ roles.
- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention (in particular Prior Informed Consent, PIC, and Environmentally Sound Management, ESM, of hazardous wastes) as well as the future Hong Kong Convention.
- The new regulation needs to set out an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation’s requirements.
- With regards to hazardous waste management, the “Green Ship Recycling Strategy” needs to include a solution for the destruction of PCBS (which is not yet possible in India), and a system to track hazardous waste to avoid illegal dumping or the repartition of hazardous materials into the market, the establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.
- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training. A two day training is not sufficient for workers to work safely in a hazardous industry. Workers needs to be handed out certificates and training efforts needs to be documented.
- With regards to workers’ rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, the immediate improvement of workers’ living conditions including drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.
- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a new draft law on asbestos safety.
- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary. Compliance needs to be monitored especially with regards to: workers’ registration for social benefits, migrant workers’ registration, provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), application of environmental, health and safety procedures, use of obligatory on-site pollution control and safety gadgets, periodic monitoring of maintenance and improvements of on-site equipment, provision of sufficient, improved and satisfactory on-site health care system, adequate training status of workers and awareness of hazards, maintenance of hazardous waste inventory and disposal.
- The Government should ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, thus prohibit the import of hazardous waste, and the Hong Kong Convention and seek early compliance with the provisions under the latter. Moreover, the Government should enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention.
- The Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify “hot spots” that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations’ expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense in Pakistan and Bangladesh and the Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.
- The Government needs to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking. They need to allow for transparency and enhance civil society involvement. Moreover, they should embrace the active participation of trade unions and promote their independent and democratic structures.",Some court cases have been won and other lost; the overall court case is ongoing.,"Despite significant decisions towards environmental and social protection have been taken by both the Supreme Court and legislative organs, the Indian ship breaking industry remains a hazardous industry for both workers and the environment. The Supreme Court orders are not implemented fully and existing rules and regulations are not strictly enforced by the relevant authorities. Indian media has reported about a corrupted system in which environmantal and OHS certificates can be bought. Due to the lack of adequate infrastructure and equipment as well as deficient law enforcement, proper waste handling procedures are not always followed and the waste streams are not documented. For instance, there is no PCB destruction plant available.

"During the public debate conducted by the Special Commission for public debate (CPDP) between 2021 and april 2022, some alternatives were proposed by the public._x000D_
_x000D_
First, even if the question of wether the project should or not be done at all was not asked in the previous plan, the process of the public debate put it on the table. _x000D_
_x000D_
Indeed, even if the State said the 2015's concertation were concluded with a consensus, the public debate of 2021 showed it was not the case. By ignoring the question of wether or not doing the project, and already proposing an extension, the State did not set good trust conditions for the population. [12] Up to 15 900 people participated in the debate, and the Commission concluded that the only way to go forward with the project with the consent of the public was to push it foward outwards in the sea. While the public showed its adhesion to the objective of energetic transition, they did not think it was realistic with this project and were arguing in favor of energetic sobriety. They insisted on the poor choice of the area regarding biodiversity, the local economy (fishing, tourism) and the local heritage. Moreover, the CNDP adviced to have a spacial planification with a vision on 20 to 30 years to offer visibility to the local actors. _x000D_
_x000D_
From this debate emerged an alternative proposed by certains participants: a park of 1GW outside of the natural park and the coastal fishing zone (more than 20 miles), and then a second park more on the west with a mutualized connection. For the fiercest opponents to the project, settling outside the natural park does not eliminate the risks for migratory birds and other marine ecosystem on which there are less knowledge. For other, those hypothesis call for more research. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another question arising then was the cost, and if it would still be doable in a more remote area. The CNDP asked independant experts. They concluded that, taken into account that the offshore windmills technologies have been progressing very fast those past years,  a more remote park could be as competitive pricewise than a coastal one. A change to floating wind power should be considered from a certain distance from the coast. [12]_x000D_
_x000D_
Thus, the Commission adressed the following recommendation to the Minister of Ecology and the RTE: ""submit to the candidates for the future call for tenders a study area that is ""sufficiently large and extended further offshore"". This suggestion is a priori supported by a first ""technical exploration"" carried out by two consultancy firms, which it has called upon. The objective: to be able to envisage a wind farm outside the natural marine park and the coastal fishing zone [beyond the 20-mile limit of 70 metres in depth]. ""Without exploding the costs"", Francis Beaucire explains. _x000D_
_x000D_
While a local representative in charge of animating the project said that this option will be taken into account, the State and RTE had until july 2022 to answer the observations of the CPDP and determine whether or not they launch competitive bidding for future developers. [14]_x000D_
_x000D_
On the 27th of July 2022, the State announced there will be a first and then a second call for tenders for the installation of two wind farms of about 1,000 MW each off the island of Oléron. It has also revised its position on their location, and the nearest one to Oléron will be 40 kms distant, outside the natural park and coastal fishery zones. [19] _x000D_
_x000D_
However, this remains insufficiant for the fishers, environmental organizations and some local representatives. Some call for a zone even further the coast, up to 60 or 70kms away. Some environmental studies are still needed to completely define the construction zone of the projet, which is planned for 2030. [20]",,"Following the decision of the French State of July 2022 to continue the project in a zone further away from the coast, there are still resistances from environmental organizations, and more environmental investigations to do on the new zone before the beginning of the construction of the projet.

These teachers encompass comprehensive cultural and academic lessons into one curriculum, giving students both the internal, traditional knowledge as well as preparing students with knowledge ranging from English to Math. KCLC works to restore Cochiti's lost culture as well as providing paid employment opportunities to the people of Cochiti [10].

Furthermore, seeing that Cochiti Pueblo has a population of 528 people [3], Cochiti Lake Town has a larger population which maintains the fact that the people of Cochiti continue to be the minority of their own homelands.

Furthermore, the physical structure of the dam remains a constant, 5.5 mile long physical reminder of how the United States treats indigenous communities; Gene Ka-hee explains how this dam ""... stretches an irreversible shadow across our land.” In addition to all these injustices that still have not been solved, the future of Cochiti Pueblo remains unknown and burdened onto the people of Cochiti. The Army Corps of Engineers constructed the Cochiti Dam with a constrained lifespan of no more than 100 years, leaving no plan for the removal or replacement of this dam in place for when the time comes.

""However, in reality, the trust that the activists had in the capacity or willingness of the governement and mining companies to enforce environmental legislation and to respond to local concerns adequately was diminishing as gold mining activities expanded into new areas and mining-related conflicts became reported more frequently. The well-know success of the Ingo River in suspending 36 out of 37 mining licenses and the resulting credibility was in jeopardy as new mining licences were issued and the revoke ones reclaimed.

(...) It has multifunctional advantages both for the movement and for local people to succeed. First, they intended that this would maintain the water level of the river. Second, according to the legislation permits, any land with cultivated trees and bushes can be privatised by those who cultivate it; local herders can own land along the river, which prevents the loss of local pasture around the river to mining companies. Third, they can profit from the berries by selling them, and the movement can be self-funded in the future by using the income"". ""He also founded a herd for the movement (...)

"Recommendation for downstream companies in the gold supply chain. Companies in the gold supply chain, such as refineries, electronics companies, jewellery and banks, should take steps to ban mercury in (artisanal) mining. Move beyond the area of conflict minerals in your due diligence with regard to the gold used in your products; do not focus solely on gold sourced from the DRC and neighbouring countries but extend your policies to all countries producing (artisanal) gold. Companies must map – if possible, jointly – their entire gold supply chains including the artisanal gold supply, and share this information publicly. Companies have to know which countries, specific regions and suppliers they source gold from, carry out a risk assessment of all the countries and regions involved, and identify in which supply chains and at what specific points the company can use its influence to achieve a positive impact. The risks identified have to be mitigated through initiatives taken by companies together with other stakeholders. It is crucial to involve local organisations and initiatives in both risk assessment and remediation efforts.  An engagement with actors within the supply chain, as well as other local actors, to work towards progressive improvement in the artisanal and small scale mining – including formalization and improving working conditions for adult workers -, is to be preferred over avoidance of artisanal mining.  Work with and/or support local initiatives to get children from gold mine areas to school and to make sure that all children receive full-time quality education. Recommendations for CSO’s  Initiatives on eliminating child labour in artisanal mining should be done in cooperation with other efforts on combatting child labour and improving the educational infrastructure and quality - either by the government and/or local or national NGOs, community based organizations and trade unions  Social and communities empowerment programs are further encouraged in mining communities targeting all children including underprivileged children (i.e. orphans, children from poor families etc.) in these communities. The programs should focus on ensuring these children remain in school and that these children receive quality education. To the Ugandan Government  Work with local stakeholders (local government, companies, mining cooperatives, mine owners, NGOs, unions, local child rights groups, etc.) to raise awareness about child labour, and set up programmes to prevent and remedy both this and other labour rights violations found in mining sites.  Work with pan-African and/or regional African organizations (e.g. ECOWAS) to develop programmes that tackle child labour and improve working conditions for adult workers in goldproducing communities. Wherever possible, channel these efforts into the context of regularising illegal mining.  Ensure an effective control of mines operating within the bounds of legality, and take action to tackle both money-laundering and the smuggling of gold to other countries.  Take measures to abolish the use of mercury in gold mining  Improve the education infrastructure and make sure that all children in mining areas receive full-time quality education without charging fees or paying other costs.  Adopt legal provisions on small scale and artisanal mines, including attention to working conditions and child labour, that effectively prevent child labour in gold mines under 18 and provides decent working conditions for adults.  Investigate the number and working conditions of children participating in mining and activities related to mining, and share these with the public, policy makers and other stakeholders.

STOP TAR SANDS MINING IN MADAGASCAR,,"Tar sands (also referred to as oil sands) are a combination of clay, sand, water, and bitumen, a heavy black viscous oil. Tar sands can be mined and processed to extract the oil-rich bitumen, which is then refined into oil. Tar sand deposits are mined, usually using strip mining or open pit techniques, or the oil is extracted by underground heating with additional upgrading._x000D_
Oil sands recovery processes include extraction and separation systems to separate the bitumen from the clay, sand, and water that make up the tar sands. Bitumen also requires additional upgrading before it can be refined. Because it is so viscous (thick), it also requires dilution with lighter hydrocarbons to make it transportable by pipelines._x000D_
Both mining and processing of tar sands involve a variety of environmental impacts, such as global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, disturbance of mined land; impacts on wildlife and air and water quality. The development of a commercial tar sands industry in Madagascar would also have significant social and economic impacts on local communities. Of special concern in the relatively arid western Region of Madagascar is the large amount of water required for tar sands processing; currently, tar sands extraction and processing require several barrels of water for each barrel of oil produced, though some of the water can be recycled._x000D_

They created a shift in priority from mobility to health.","The outcome so far is that ever since the first plans were made in 2000, the project has changed several times - usually after pressure from the action groups. The most recent changes were in 2009, after the referendum and in February 2014, after the EIA. However, the two central pillars of the conflict have not changed (where to make a 3th highway  crossing over the river De Schelde and the need to decrease pollution for the 150.000 that live so close to the existing ring road that their health is impaired)","There have been successes in the sense that action groups have so far managed to keep the government from constructing the 3th highway crossing and that the current plan is already a not so bad as the first plan. However, a battle is ongoing to scrap the plan from BAM and to implement the plan from Ringland (although one does not replace the other)  On May 4, over 10.000 people demonstrated for this double cause. Opinion polls show a big progress for both the green and the radical left party in Antwerp, together winning 25% of the vote (from 15% together in last elections) - at least in part because these parties support the action groups and have always been against the plans from BAM. This has some repercussions on the regional elections slated for May 25.

1. APROVECHAR LA INFRAESTRUCTURA EXISTENTE:
una línea de alta tensión de 66kV, apoyada sobre 33 torres, que costó millones de euros y perjudicó gravemente a muchos de ciudadanos y ecosistemas, ha acabado suministrando electricidad a sólo cinco abonados a 15 Kv. La propuesta de aprovechar la infraestructura existente ha sido avalada por el Colegio de ingenieros industriales de les Illes Balears y ademas cumple mejor que los dos proyectos de Red Eléctrica Española (REE) el marco del sector eléctrico español que opta por la propuesta que garantice un suministro eléctrico de calidad y que suponga menos costes tanto económicos como medioambientales.
2. RECUPERAR EL PROYECTO DE GESA-ENDESA
Esta línea de 66kV fue construida por Gesa-Endesa para hacer la misma función que harían las dos futuras líneas, apoyadas sobre 110 torres, proyectadas por REE (Red Eléctrica Española) si finalmente se llegan a instalar. Además la tensión de la línea existente se ajusta a las necesidades indicadas en el Plano Director Sectorial de las Islas Baleares que planificó líneas de 66kV para garantizar un suministro eléctrico de calidad a la zona cuando el consumo y las expectativas poblacionales eran muy superiores a las actuales. REE, con el visto bueno del Gobierno Central, ha planificado dos líneas de 132kV, una tensión que no necesitamos y que supondrá la instalación de torres más altas y más destrucción de paisaje.
3. JUSTIFICAR MEDIANTE UN NUEVO ESTUDIO EL CAMBIO De ESTÁNDAR ELÉCTRICO:
Un cambio de estándar (de 66kv a 132kv) que tantas consecuencias negativas tendrá para nuestro territorio y forma de vida tendría que estar justificado sobre un estudio que analice las necesidades actuales, puesto que la población y el consumo han bajado considerablemente, y que se adapte a nuestra forma de vida y características territoriales que son diferentes de las de la península, todo ello a las puertas de la transición al nuevo modelo energético donde el autoconsumo será el protagonista y por lo tanto serán necesarias menos líneas de alta tensión.
4. PARALIZAR LA EJECUCIÓN DE TODAS LAS LÍNEAS PROYECTADAS A LAS BALEARES HASTA QUE SE HAYA REALIZADO UN ESTUDIO QUE DETERMINE El ESTÁNDAR ELÉCTRICO MÁS ADECUADO POR NUESTRAS ISLAS.
En la plataforma pensamos que la problemática (medioambiental, social y económica) de las líneas Llucmajor-Cala Blava/Cala Blava-Arenal es extensible a todos los proyectos de futuras líneas que se quieren ejecutar a las islas. Por eso nuestra petición de parar la ejecución de todos los proyectos de líneas de alta tensión en las Baleares hasta que se hagan los estudios necesarios para determinar cuál es el estándar más adecuado para las islas y planificar las infraestructuras necesarias para alcanzar el consumo eléctrico actual de los isleños.
5. QUE TODAS LAS NUEVAS LÍNEAS SE HAGAN SOTERRADAS POR CAMINOS PÚBLICOS SIGUIENDO EL PROTOCOLO DE ANULACIÓN DE CAMPOS ELECTROMAGNÉTICOS.
Respecto a la parte de la línea existente que todavía queda por construir en la línea Llucmajor-Cala Blava, la Plataforma opina que el soterramiento por caminos públicos, siguiendo el protocolo de anulación de campos electromagnéticos, está plenamente justificado por:
-El dinero público ahorrado por el aprovechamiento de la línea existente se pueden invertir en el soterramiento de las partes de la línea que quedan por construir.
-El ofrecimiento del alcalde de Llucmajor de ceder gratuitamente los caminos públicos para el soterramiento de las líneas también supondría un importante ahorro en indemnizaciones a los propietarios de los terrenos afectados por el paso de la línea.
-Iríamos por el camino que han tomado los países más avanzados de la UE (Holanda, Dinamarca, Francia, Gb, Alemania…) que optan cada vez más por el soterramiento para evitar la problemática medio ambiental, social y económica que implican este tipo de proyectos.
-Evitaríamos la destrucción de la Marina de Llucmajor, de importantísimo valor medio ambiental, que supondrá la instalación de las dos líneas aéreas proyectadas por REE
-Evitaríamos la inquietud social que provoca la exposición a campos electromagnéticos que tiene su reflejo en los estudios de la Comisión Europea sobre el tema.*5
Como en la plataforma pensamos que la problemática (medio ambiental, social y económica) de las líneas Llucmajor-Cala Blava/Cala Blava-Arenal es extensible a todos los proyectos de futuras líneas que se quieran ejecutar en las islas hacemos extensiva nuestra demanda de soterramiento para todas las nuevas líneas eléctricas que se instalen a las islas.",,"Progressive G'ment in Balearic Islands these days (2017) seems to be aware of these plans, and has applied to declare the area IBA.

,"The RCA horrible case has brought to light many loopholes in the Taiwanese laws and regulations._x000D_
“Before the RCA incident, Taiwan lacked effective laws and environmental regulations ,” says Chou, the lawyer representing the RCA Taiwan former workers. At that time, the Taiwanese government was not adequately prepared to deal with matters involving environmental protection and occupational hazards. It was not until 2000 that Taiwan enacted the Soil and Groundwater Pollution Remediation Act and established the “polluter pays principle” to deter violators. The case also led to the revision of the labor insurance regulation to make breast removal eligible for disability compensation, a significant advance on the rights of Taiwanese female workers.","On April 17 2015, the Taipei District Court rendered a verdict in favor of former assembly line workers visiting the now-defunct electronics company, Radio Corporation of America. Yet, it is possible that the compensation would be unattainable.
When the team of Taiwanese attorneys applied to the courts to provisionally seize RCA's assets for investigation, they found out RCA had already transferred its assets out of Taiwan roughly around the same time when it was held accountable for the cleanup between 1996 and 1997.
It may be difficult for the Taiwanese workers to file a lawsuit in the United States because the allegations stem from abroad.  Court rulings in 2017 have given larger compensations.

At the beginning of 1998, Cape’s application was granted by the trial court, but the Court of Appeals later reversed the lower court’s decision. In 1999, another 2000 claims were commenced against Cape in England for ARD based on Cape’s activity in South Africa. Cape reapplied to stay these new claims, in addition to those filed in 1997, and Cape’s application was granted. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court’s ruling. The plaintiffs then appealed to the UK House of Lords, and in 2000 the Law Lords held that the case should be allowed to continue in the English High Court. The Law Lords found that South African courts would not be a viable alternative forum because legal aid in South Africa had been withdrawn for personal injury claims and no reasonable likelihood existed for the plaintiffs to acquire effective legal representation on a contingency fee basis for a case of such complexity. After the House of Lords decision, more claimants joined the case, and by 2001 there were approximately 7500 claimants.

Once a shared vision – the promotion of ecotourism as a tool for both nature conservation and economic development - is established, a rethinking of the cooperative arrangements between the two authorities could result. These cooperative arrangements are required to support the horizontal integration of the resources necessary to achieve the shared vision. In this regard, the EEAA pinpointed an issue that was key to the successful containment of the inherent conflict over ecotourism development in Wadi el Gemal – that being, the desire to sustain the quality and ecological integrity of the resources base in the WGPA (Moneer, 2015).
The TDA also showed concern for the ecological sustainability of the area, although for different reasons. The TDA’s reasons related to their desire to maintain the quality of the ecotourism experience itself. In this regard, the TDA highlighted that the quality of the ecotourism experience is not only based on the beauty and integrity of the natural resources, but also on the level of interaction with nature, and the expectations and experiences of the ecotourists themselves. The last two factors are discussed in other studies, for example, Boyd and Butler (1996).
According to the results Moneer's (2015) study, monitoring, information sharing and law enforcement are the three main policy tools that were defined as important in promoting integration and partnership between the two agencies, in order to achieve and maintain the sustainable management of the WGPA ",,"If the legal chaos in Egypt is settled and if the two authorities that are responsible for the management and development of natural resources are managed to work in cooperation and shared vision, this will contribute to environmental justice",Not sure,Stopped,tourism-development-versus-nature-conservation-conflict-in-wadi-el-gemal-protected-area-along-the-egyptian-red-sea,6.0,#46a546,

"The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on the governments in ship-owning countries (in particular: the EU and its Member States, Japan, China, Singapore, and the US) to prohibit the export of end-of-life vessels to South Asian shipbreaking countries as long as:
- end-of-life vessels contain significant amounts of hazardous waste;
- the shipbreaking countries cannot prove that all hazardous waste is removed, store, treated, disposed or destructed in a fully clean and safe way;
- working and living conditions of shipbreaking workers remain inadequate;
- shipbreaking does not take place in modern ship recycling facilities off the beach with minimum technical and infrastructural requirements allowing for the containment of pollutions and workers’ health and safety.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on ship owners, to only sell the end-of-life vessels to modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. In 2016, the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards, which responsible ship owners can use.
The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and the Sustainable Development Policy Institute recommend the following actions to the Federal and Provincial Governments, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:
- The Federal Government together with the relevant provincial authorities should develop and implement a «Green Ship Recycling Strategy», that is a cross-departmental policy to formalise the sector and to allow for the much needed change towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO.
- The Federal Government and the provincial authorities should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure. As the investment needed for compliance with international standards, especially with regards to waste management, is beyond the financial capacity of the shipbreaking industry in Pakistan, development banks or the Global Environment Facility (GEF), for example, could assist Pakistan in altering its shipbreaking practices to become safe and clean.
- The «Green Ship Recycling Strategy» should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).
- The Government of Pakistan should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia – India and Bangladesh – in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a ‘level playing field’ is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.
- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Federal Government together with the Provincial Government need to develop a sector-specific «Regulation for Green Ship Recycling in Pakistan». The new Regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between the national and provincial level with regards to legal requirements and the institutional framework after the 18th amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (the decentralisation) and needs to clearly define the competent authorities’ roles.
- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention as well as the future Hong Kong Convention.
- The new regulation needs to set out the authorisation criteria for facilities, to establish a set of rules for facility operation, including the procedures to obtain permits for different kinds of hazardous work, clearly define which authority needs to issue certificates and approvals, and set up an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation’s requirements.
- With regards to hazardous waste management, the “Green Ship Recycling Strategy” needs to include a plan to establish: a reception facility for operationally and non-operationally generated waste at a port close to the yards with a mandatory port call for all imported end-of-life vessels to perform cleaning activities such as cleaning cargo tanks, emptying bilge tanks, paint and chemical stores, and unloading waste oil and surplus fuel, waste storage on the yards,  waste reception facilities such as a sanitary landfill,  disposal treatment facility for hazardous waste such as PCBs, a system to track hazardous waste and to avoid the repartition into the market, establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.
- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should provide a training centre and seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training45.
- With regards to workers’ rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, notably the Factories Act 1934, the Industrial and Commercial Employment Ordinance 1968, the Industrial Relations Ordinance 2002, as well as relevant provisions of the Pakistan Constitution and the Pakistan Penal Code, the immediate improvement of workers’ living conditions including supply of drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.
- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a federal bill on asbestos safety.
- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary. Compliance needs to be monitored especially with regards to: workers’ registration for social benefits, provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), application of environmental, health and safety procedures, use of obligatory on-site pollution control and safety gadgets, periodic monitoring of maintenance and improvements of on-site equipment, provision of sufficient, improved and satisfactory on-site health care system, adequate training status of workers and awareness of hazards, maintenance of hazardous waste inventory and disposal.
- The Government of Pakistan should ratify the Basel Ban Amendment and Hong Kong Convention and seek early com- pliance with the provisions under the latter. Moreover, the Government should ratify ILO Convention No. 187 and enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention.
- The Government lease agreements with the economic operators should be conditional and binding to ensure that the operators comply with all provisions. The current lease amount is very low compared to the profit margins and should be adjusted accordingly. Both the revenue from leases and taxes should be invested in upgrading the facilities and the surrounding infrastructure.
- The State Bank of Pakistan should issue a directive to commercial banks for compliance with social and environmental safeguard policies and legislation with regards to loans given to the shipbreaking sector.
- The Federal Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify “hot spots” that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations’ expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense and the Federal Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.
- Both the Federal and Provincial Government need to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking. They need to allow for transparency and enhance civil society involvement. Moreover, they should embrace the active participation of trade unions and promote their inde- pendent and democratic structures.",,"Within the Pakistani scenario, the ship breaking industry remains a hazardous industry for both workers and the environment. Despite the fact that Pakistan is one of the world’s largest shipbreaking countries – currently ranking fourth in the annually scrapped volume both in terms of scrapped tonnage and in number of ships – so far only little attention has been given to the sector, both by the government as well as civil society.

"Fact-finding team has given three different sets of recommendations – one for the company, the second for the IFIs/FIs that financed the project, and the third for the state and national governments.
For the company 
1. Compute and monetize all the social and environmental costs and add these to the project costs;
2. Compensate all local people for their livelihood losses;
3. Create a fund for the restoration of mangroves destroyed;
4. Put a halt on operations until the restoration and compensation are done;
5. Immediately conduct an independent and thorough EIA , post-first Unit operation;
6. Conduct a thorough health survey of the entire population and use it as a baseline data for compensating future damage;
7. Employ all possible pollution control measures on a war footing, to save this fragile zone from further damage;
8. Restore peoples access to fishing and grazing grounds, and to salt-pans unconditionally;
9. Provide compensation and medical facilities to help people cope with pollution related problems.
For Government of India and Gujarat
1. Put a moratorium on permission to any more industry/power plants in Mundra/Kutch;
2. Issue a Show Cause to the CGPL/Tata Mundra for multiple violations of clearance conditions;
3. Constitute independent expert committee(s) to thoroughly investigate all pollution, contamination and radioactivity hazard within a reasonable time frame;
4. Based on any such independent expert report, take punitive actions;
5. Do not subsidize the power produced and sold by CGPL by increasing the contracted tariff;
6. All national banks/financial institutions should be directed to adopt sound social and environmental safeguard policies at a reasonable timeframe and their implementation should be made mandatory.
For Financial Institutions 
1. The IFIs should undertake an immediate review of the project to examine adherence of their safeguard polices;
2. Until such a review is done, their financial assistance to the project should be suspended. If review concludes that the project is undesirable or unviable, the IFIs should withdraw from it;
3. IFIs should put in place an independent monitoring mechanism to ensure strict compliance of their safeguard policies.
4. National financial institutions should adopt social and environmental policies and should implement them scrupulously in this project. The implementation should be monitored by independent agencies, which include the affected peoples representatives [1].",,"The project has disproportionately high social, environmental, and economic costs.

",Resistencias pacificas ,"Desde el 2012 la comunidad solicitaba la negación del título de la licencia para la explotación petrolera del proyecto Llanos 36 3D, realizada principalmente por las empresas ECOPETROL y MONTECZ, ya  que sólo en su primera fase, la sísmica, hubo significativos impactos ambientales y sociales negativos. A mediados del 2013 con la resolución 0679, la ANLA frena el avance de este proyecto negando la solicitud de las empresas para perforar pozos en busca de petróleo en 13 veredas de Acacías y tres de Villavicencio. 
No obstante, la lucha no termina, debido a que la empresa puede apelar a otras instancias, como solicitar nuevamente la licencia presentando 
planes de manejo ambiental, o poniendo en marcha nuevos proyectos. Como 
sucedió en octubre del 2013, cuando José Yesid Moreno, ingeniero de 
Ecopetrol y director del proyecto CPO-9, explicó que este posee la 
licencia ambiental por parte de la Autoridad Nacional de 
Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) para adelantar la construcción de 10 
plataformas y que cada una de ellas incluirá hasta 3 pozos. Adicionó,

As for example Silva (2009) notes, Tucuruí and other megaprojects in the 1970s and 1980s – such as the Carajás mineral exploration project, the establishment of the aluminum industries and further infrastructures – followed a ‘development’ and ‘modernization’ model that led to the expansion of productive activities in the Amazon region. This colonization not only caused environmental degradation but also particularly affected the material and socio-cultural basis of social groups historically excluded from public policies: traditional populations and migrated families living from small-scale agriculture and extractivism. These faced negative consequences such as displacement or involuntary resettlement, a disruption of their local economies and mode of living, cultural damage, and the appropriation of land – which not least intensified territorial conflict. While these communities have been struggling for their basic rights for the last three decades, this has also nurtured notable social mobilizations and successful claims for compensation in some of the cases.

Not developing petrothermal energy. Often German EJOS propose to rather invest in less risky renewable energies like wind or solar. Occasionally they also pledged for rather a coal burning power plant instead of deep geothermal power.,,"The project was a success from the position of the EJO. If the EJO and the town parliament represented the popular opinion, the vote against the geothermal drilling was a success in terms of respect towards the local democratic will. Numerous similar initiatives against deep geothermal drillings in other parts of Germany, especially the south, relate to Meiningen as an inspiring success. 
However another point of view is that each region should contribute to the energy transition (energiewende), counting geothermal energy as part of renewable energy technologies. That is often the main argument in favour of deep Geothermal energy, that it is for the common good, the energy transition. Such a position is supported by all environmental NGO. Only one report from the German NGO BUND raised critical concerns on geothermal power (Strom und Wärmeerzeugung aus Geothermie, BUND 2007).
Some anti-geothermal initiatives question in how far geothermal is renewable. Briefly, their argument is that the detriments like water pollution and earthquakes are not proportional to the amount of energy generated. (Often the equivalent of one or a few big wind turbines) The second argument is, that deep GT sites can buy very cheap electricity at industry tariffs (11 c per KwH) and ""transform"" it into renewable electricity to be sold for 25 c per KwH. The rationale is, that in contrast to PV or wind, a certain part of electricity has to be invested for the pumping process, before Geothermal generates electricity.
The debate on the status of GT is still ongoing. A majority of international and national environmental NGO is in favour of deep GT. A minority doubts the merits of GT.
