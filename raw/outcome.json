Based on the success of this project, T\u00dcRK-\u0130\u015e and the Ministry will take steps to spread the project to the whole of Turkey [8].

In other words, informal wastepickers need to be integrated into the municipal wastecollecting teams in order to receive social security [10]. This effort is an ongoing process as Karaman is currently conducting negotiations with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and aims to integrate wastepickers in the municipal wastecollecting teams as part of Turkey\u2019s nation-wide \u201cZero Waste Regulation\u201d [11].

Another alternative that was cited in the official CHPE Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in 2014 was the \"No Action Alternative,\" where the project would be cancelled entirely [10]. This solution was not widely considered, especially because of new pressure to quickly invest in more clean energy to comply with Governor Cuomo\u2019s New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

{"suggested_alternatives":"The Barh Mukti Abhiyan has been at the forefront of constructive and robust critique of \u2018hard engineering solutions\u2019 in favour of soft flood control strategies based on local channel diversions and drainage network systems for containing and routing flood water through agricultural areas and wetlands. The Abhiyan\u2019s foundation is based on a belief that the local communities would be self-reliant and achieve better control of floods than what is even possible by current embankment and dam operations [5,10]. The embankments provide a false sense of security to people, but instead can worsen floods by not allowing releases of water (in fact, embankments have been broken down by people in some cases to allow flood waters to find their way) [7,10]. The problem of flood risk for lakhs of people trapped between embankments needs urgent resolution by identifying solutions for better resettlement of affected families. Currently, displaced settlements regularly have to move around, with an interval of about 3 years at any given site. This lack of livelihood security has also led to cases of violent conflict between displaced refugees and settled village populations in the countryside. \nHydrologists have also identified the better management of barrage operations in order to provide ecological flow regimes in the river channel through the dry season, at a steady flow rate. It is argued that the current modified extremes will reduce the intensity with which barrages are compelled to release waters (in a burst, typically) at the onset of the monsoonal flooding season. Managing releases from barrages based on ecological flow (e-flow) regime guidelines would also temper down the ultimate impact of immediate alarm situations that often occur due to extreme rainfall in the Himalayan catchments or with breaches of upstream embankments [28]. E-flow maintainance also involves allocating and using irrigation water with greater efficiency and productive output, improving communication across different sectors demanding water, and decentralized management of canal and groundwater irrigation systems. These solutions are more at a systemic level but their flood management implications are critical. \nMore proximate solutions include providing aid packages to displaced as well as embankment-trapped villages, better alarm systems (e.g. Flood Management Information System-Bihar), and improved disaster response both on part of the state and civil society.

Baghel (2014) accurately points out that despite wide acknowledgment of these problems and risks, governments continue to wholly depend on the same flood control approaches, citing immediacy and the need for more engineering to mend the failures of current engineering. Underlying this rigidity are many factors, right from a rationality that remains persistent despite its chequered but long history, the drive for control of landscape boundaries and revenue, and political strategies and corruption that is based on maintaining risk in societies for continued reproduction of power structures and control.","success_level":"Not sure","name":"In operation","slug":"environmental-injustice-and-social-vulnerability-due-to-dams-embankments-and-bank-erosion-in-the-ganga-kosi-floodplains-of-bihar-india","id":5.0,"color":"#ee2c2c","project_status":null}

It seems to have been done deliberately, to avoid embarrassing questions about the cost-benefit analysis of the project. \nThe committee demands that the present process of land acquisition at Gobindpura should be immediately halted as it is illegal, undemocratic and contrary to the policy framework designed by the Govt itself. The acquired land should be returned to their owners.\nAll the houses and house-sites acquired should be returned to their owners and damage caused to them should be compensated.\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Poena Power Co. for setting up this project should be cancelled and all new projects should be allowed only through competitive bidding in public sector.\nCompany should be asked to get the land required for the project from the land owners, through direct negotiations and the Govt should not interfere in this process.\nA thorough inquiry be ordered through central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI), in the manner this project was awarded and in the process of land acquisition, and the guilty should be punished.\nThe people of Gobindpura should be suitably compensated for loss of crops, livelihood, habitat, liberty etc., suffered by them during this period, due to repressive measures adopted by the State.\nAppropriate criminal cases be registered against all those police officials who resorted to illegal arrests and detentions, assaults and lathi-charge, caused death of Surjit Singh Hamidi and injuries to many others, damaged vehicles, during the struggle and they should be suitably punished.\nAll police barricades should be lifted from around village Gobindpura and the liberty and democratic rights of the people be restored [1,5].\nFarmers agitating against land acquisition for the Govindpura (Mansa) thermal plant in Punjab have suspended their agitation till September 13, 2011 after talks between them and Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.

No compensation has been paid to them on the excuse that the land on which these houses were constructed was not in their name.\nTotal compensation package ranging from Rs. 23.23 lakhs to Rs.23.77 lakh per acre, including displacement allowances and no litigation incentive etc has been announced, which is very meager. The Govt is paying Rs. 23.77 lakhs per acre for 80 acres, Rs.23.54 lakhs for 560 acres and Rs. 23.23 lakhs for 166 acres to the landowners. \nThere is no provision for providing employment to the project affected families in the Rehabilitation Policy.

As already mentioned a considerable section of agriculturists families of the village (about 185) have turned landless or marginal farmers after the acquisition of their lands. They are not able to buy lands in adjoining villages at the rates on which their own lands have been acquired. So they are bound to suffer displacement & loss of livelihood.\nAbout 40 percent of population of the village belongs to Scheduled Caste & Backward Classes.

{"suggested_alternatives":"International aid organizations: Open Society Foundations and European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) have been confronted with an abundance of challenges in attempting to move the Roma away from the toxic campsites. Many Roma lack the birth certificates and citizenship documents necessary to obtain jobs, housing permits, and permission to move freely outside of the camps [3]. A criminal complaint filed with the Kosovo prosecutor in September 2005 against unknown perpetrators alleging criminal neglect resulting in prolonged exposure to a highly toxic environment did not result in an investigation [7]. A complaint filed by the international NGO the European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) in February 2006 with the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of Roma IDPs was ruled inadmissible on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over UNMIK-administered Kosovo [7]. The ERRC then started a campaign following a damning report published by the Human Rights Advisory Panel in 2016. This panel called on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to publicly acknowledge its abject failure to comply with applicable human rights standards and apologise to Roma placed in lead contaminated camps, and to compensate victims for material and moral damage [4]. In 2016, the Human Rights Advisory Panel (HRAP) of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) released an opinion on the case [11]. The opinion concluded that numerous articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child were violated by UNMIK. Among the human rights identified by the Advisory Panel as being violated were the rights to life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, health, respect for private and family life, an adequate standard of living, and suffered discrimination. Numerous violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child were identified, including exploitation. The HRAP found that for many years, UNMIK failed to make sufficient efforts to relocate the displaced families despite awareness of serious risk to the internally displaced community\u2019s health and wellbeing from the toxic contamination present in the camps. HRAP recommended that UNMIK make a public apology to the victims and their families, as well as take appropriate steps towards payment of adequate individual compensation for both material and moral damage to 138 members of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities who resided in the camps from 1999 [11]. Then in 2019, 55 Members of the European Parliament wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, expressing dismay at the UN\u2019s failure to remedy harm inflicted on ethnic minorities in Kosovo. The letter urges the Secretary General \u201cto ensure that the victims of widespread lead poisoning at UN-run camps in Kosovo receive individual compensation, adequate health care and educational support\u201d [9]. In 2019, the UNMIK expressed \u201cprofound regret\u201d that hundreds of Roma [including Ashkali and Balkan Egyptian]  were poisoned by lead waste while living in camps run by the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.

Together with this, SSMNA also pushes the passing into law of the Forest Resources Bill which prioritizes the protection of our remaining forests. Budget for forest protection must also be increased. Any reforestation program would be irrelevant if forest protection, which should include genuine logging moratorium as well as mining moratorium, is not seriously prioritized. \nSSMNA also strongly recommends uncorrupted repairs and improvements of the already existing dams, including the entire water pipe system.

The project which is entitled \u201cNational Action plan for Waste Recycling and Sorting\u201d promotes the protection of the environment, can be easily implemented and is cost effective.  According to Paul Abi Rached, founder and president of the organization, the NAWRAS transitional plan is Eco friendly and it can provide around $50 million for the government. The project consists of the mandatory sorting and separation of waste into organic, inorganic and hazardous material at the level of households, establishments, stores, restaurants, etc. by installing green and red garbage bins in the streets for the disposal of the separated waste. The waste is then collected by garbage trucks and transported to several facilities. Generally, the organic waste is carried to a composting plant, the inorganic waste is recycled and the hazardous waste is stored. Thus, the main purpose of the plan is to reduce the amount of waste dumped into the temporary landfills, including the one in Costa Brava, from 2400 tons\/day to 300 tons\/day.

Nevertheless, Paul Abi Rached indicated that politicians and government actors are trying to postpone the court date by applying pressure on Judge Hasan Hamdan in order to change his decision of permanently closing the landfill. In his opinion, these people are trying hard to keep residents away from the site because, later on, it would be beneficial for the establishment of other projects.

Because hunting would be allowed during the period that defines membership in the PCFG, Alternative 4 would also include restrictions specifically intended to manage impacts to the PCFG. Key restrictions include avoiding female whales, setting an annual total mortality limit using the PBR approach described for Alternative 3 (but using a lower recovery factor and accounting for other sources of human26 caused mortality), and the presumption that all whales struck but not landed are PCFG whales.

The pedestrian paths themselves are to be made free of obstacles and smooth for wheelchair usage, while the cycling tracks are to be segregated with physical barriers that prevent encroaching by motor vehicles. Further, these cycling tracks are to be connected on a greater scale so that accessing more distant parts of the city on bicycle is possible. For even greater distances, the guidelines also include creating a network of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes for an uninterrupted public transportation experience. Other design elements include providing shade trees to pedestrian and cyclists, traffic calming speed-breakers in residential areas, intuitive universal signage (traffic signals etc.), street furniture (seating, trash bins etc.) and other features. ","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"As far as conceptualising a vision for an alternative transportation system that is based on equitable access and sustainability is concerned, the project can be considered as a success. However, the project is lagging behind in implementation. By the original timeline of the project, a draft plan was to be placed before the Pune Municipal Corporation General Body by September-October 2016. Instead the corporation felt a need for an additional survey to obtain a more updated data-set on the feasibility of creating a cycle share program. The consultants hired to carry out this survey have submitted their report, but there has been no discussion on the matter as of December 2016. \nWhile the municipal commissioner is enthusiastic about the project, the structure of the corporation is a potential hurdle to successful implementation of the project guidelines. The final responsibility of implementing design schemes lies with the corporators of each ward and not all of them share the same interest as the commissioner does. This seems to be an important determinant, as observed in road maintenance on current stretches of roads and existing cycle tracks.\nA more serious impediment however could be the metro link project that has been approved by the corporation simultaneously, under the Smart City plan of the central government. The metro project was not part of the comprehensive mobility plan for Pune, and is not a recommendation of the technical consultants. The estimated cost of building a metro network is 10,500 crore rupees with the stated aim of transporting 7 lakh people per day by 2031. However, the existing bus network in Pune already transports more than 10 lakh people per day. The relationship between the metro project and the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is thus not mutually complimentary. In fact the commissioner himself has been quoted as saying that \u2018the metro is a glamour project, but that the future lies in the bicycle.\u2019 As such, the go-ahead given to the metro project seems like a move made under pressure from the larger political machinery of the state and the country, in keeping with the grandiose neoliberal vision of \u2018smart\u2019 cities. \nIn summary, this case cannot yet be considered an environmental justice success since it is still in the planning stage, and faces issues of both implementation and interference in the time to come.

{"suggested_alternatives":"If you are familiar with this climate justice fight, you may have already read about the City\u2019s plan to bulldoze the entire East River Park in the August issue of the Indypendent and our demands for a green new deal for our community. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe community in collaboration with Rebuild By Design developed an earlier plan [also see https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xkpNSTg6LXs  and  http:\/\/www.rebuildbydesign.org\/data\/files\/675.pdf starting at p. 50 for East River Park] which was more reflective of our diverse community and our needs. The community plan was more comprehensive in providing flood protection without destroying the park. This community plan was summarily scrapped by the city and they are now planning to bring in the bulldozers next March. But together we can stop this misguided and destructive scheme._x000D_\n_x000D_\nUnlike city scheme which singularly focuses on building a massive billion dollar flood barrier, the community plan addresses flood protection in the larger context of the climate crisis. That is, it would provide much needed flood protection by expanding the park and reducing greenhouse emissions in response to this crisis. The city\u2019s $1.45 billion allocated for their scheme must be redirected to a plan that will serve the needs of our community first rather than the needs of traffic on the FDR Drive. In fact it appears that the temporary closing of one lane of the Drive, required by the Rebuild By Design options to construct the berm along the FDR, was the main reason the city scrapped them for its \u201cpreferred option.\u201d The following lays out the elements of a community plan:_x000D_\n1.\tRebuild By Design options v. NYC \u201cPreferred Option 4\u201d_x000D_\nAs everyone knows by now the city\u2019s current plan- Option 4- will bulldoze the entire park and dump 8-10 feet of landfill on it. The phrase \u201cphased construction means phased destruction\u201d voices our disagreement with the \u201cconcession\u201d by Community Board 3 that would allow this plan to move forward by destroying the park one section at a time instead of all at once. The earlier options prepared by Rebuild By Design with community input over five years are far less destructive. The last option presented to the community, before the city scrapped the entire planning process, required only 1\/3 of the park (along the western edge adjoining the FDR Drive) to be altered or bulldozed. Unlike Option 4, the Rebuild By Design options envision East River Park as a flood plain in their drawings. The removal of the astroturf and restoration of real soil and grass on the ballfields and other areas of the park would be an important element in creating a more sustainable green space. In contrast, with temperatures regularly climbing over 100 degrees, it\u2019s hard to imagine the restoration of nature atop the city\u2019s Option 4 dirt pile. More likely we\u2019ll see a new park of fake grass and maybe even plastic trees and shrubs like the potted \u201cplants\u201d in corporate lobbies._x000D_\n _x000D_\n2.\tDecking _x000D_\nThe Rebuild By Design options envisioned decking over the FDR Drive which would greatly expand East River Park and allow for far more trees and green space, which are essential in combatting climate change. The FDR Drive is already decked in a number of sections, the largest being Carl Schurz Park waterfront promenade from East 84th to East 90th Streets. In fact the Department of City Planning in its 2008 Inventory of Decking Opportunities Over Transportation Properties studied decking opportunities over additional sections of the Drive along with other highways (see attached). While these additional sections don\u2019t include the roadway adjoining East River Park, the City Planning study at least establishes a rationale for what should be done. Rather than spending huge sums on the current plan to bulldoze and raise the park 8-10 feet, the resulting savings should go towards constructing decking over the section of the FDR Drive adjoining East River Park._x000D_\n _x000D_\n3.\tFDR Drive_x000D_\nWe've already put forth the logic behind shrinking the FDR Drive and introducing dedicated bus lanes https:\/\/nyc.streetsblog.org\/2019\/07\/17\/op-ed-to-save-the-east-river-coastline-first-get-rid-of-cars-on-the-fdr-drive\/ . In addressing the issue of emissions released by the 100,000+ cars traveling the Drive each day, we now have to also consider the impact of congestion pricing which will be fully implemented in 2021. See https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/04\/24\/nyregion\/what-is-congestion-pricing.html.  Congestion pricing will have the effect of incentivizing motorists who are passing through the city to travel on the FDR Drive or West Side Highway. As jammed as it is now, even a small increase in traffic may well turn the FDR into a parking lot of polluting vehicles with motors running. A public transportation alternative for the FDR will soon become even more of a priority for our community and especially for residents living along the Drive who already have some of the highest rates of asthma in the country._x000D_\n _x000D_\nThe above three elements represent a maximum program of demands- the whole enchilada- that needs to be adopted by the city. Clearly, there will be negotiating so maybe we should at least start out by envisioning ourselves as Extinction Rebellion with infrastructure funding and political power. But these proposals are not \u201cvisionary\u201d as some will claim (they would have been visionary 30 years ago) but essential for our community\u2019s survival and a model for what\u2019s required to deal with the climate emergency. To be sure some of these ideas are \u201cimpractical\u201d given the radical restructuring required to meet our current challenges. However, in a few short years if we fail to take concerted action, \u201cpractical\u201d may mean desalinating sea water for drinking, rationing food and finding enough boats for all of us to get around.","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"Community plan was canceled.

Lo que realza su \u00e9xito es que esta iniciativa se basa en el respaldo, apoyo y participaci\u00f3n de la comunidad. Estos espacios han ido aumentando en el municipio de Cuernavaca; sin embargo, la falta de apoyo e inter\u00e9s de las autoridades dificulta el \u00e9xito y crecimiento de las propuestas ciudadanas. En Alpuyeca, a ra\u00edz del cierre del basurero, la comunidad ha continuado con la recuperaci\u00f3n de sus tradiciones como una herramienta de identidad ind\u00edgena y de resistencia ambiental. Entre las acciones en las que han avanzado se encuentra la recuperaci\u00f3n de su idioma original, el retorno a la agricultura org\u00e1nica, separaci\u00f3n de basura, evitar el uso de platos, vasos y bolsas desechables, la producci\u00f3n dom\u00e9stica de compostas en casas y escuelas, limpieza de r\u00edos, y la recuperaci\u00f3n y desarrollo de nuevos v\u00ednculos comunitarios con los pueblos ind\u00edgenas de la regi\u00f3n y otros pueblos del Estado al formar parte del Consejo de Pueblos de Morelos. Estas experiencias de solidaridad entre comunidades, cient\u00edficos y ambientalistas de la regi\u00f3n animaron la organizaci\u00f3n del Foro Estatal de basura en Alpuyeca, en marzo de 2008. En \u00e9l se discutieron las problem\u00e1ticas de basura de cada pueblo o ciudad de Morelos, y se promovi\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de empresas comunitarias de gesti\u00f3n de basura y llevar a cabo acciones espec\u00edficas para reducir la generaci\u00f3n de basura. A su vez, se propuso una agenda de educaci\u00f3n ambiental.

Las salidas planteadas por el Estado ante el cierre del basurero de Milpillas fueron la confinaci\u00f3n de los residuos en lugares inapropiados, la exportaci\u00f3n de los mismos al Estado de M\u00e9xico y la concesi\u00f3n del servicio de basura a empresas privadas, las cuales no acabaron de resolver el fen\u00f3meno y agudizaron la crisis socioambiental en la regi\u00f3n. Un ejemplo fue la licitaci\u00f3n otorgada a la empresa Promotora Ambiental S.A., para el manejo de residuos en Cuernavaca, a pesar de su larga lista de irregularidades y fraudes en el servicio ambiental de desechos t\u00f3xicos y urbanos. En julio de 2007, el gobierno anuncia p\u00fablicamente la adquisici\u00f3n de un terreno en Loma de Mej\u00eda, Temixco: zona de recarga acu\u00edfera de la cual dependen 100 mil habitantes de la regi\u00f3n, para la construcci\u00f3n del relleno sanitario donde la empresa depositar\u00eda la basura. Este hecho no se present\u00f3 sin conflicto; la negativa total de todos los pueblos de Morelos a convertirse en el nuevo Milpillas del Estado, se expres\u00f3 en los constantes bloqueos carreteros impidiendo la entrada de los camiones de basura provenientes de Cuernavaca a sus tierras. La movilizaci\u00f3n contra el relleno sanitario de Loma de Mej\u00eda se desata en agosto de 2007. Pese a sus esfuerzos, el 6 de enero de 2009, la empresa deposita las primeras tres mil toneladas de basura en el sitio.

A 2011 Israeli state comptroller report provided that the industrial settlement (referred to as Mesila) is unauthorized and is constructed without building permits through the takeover of Palestinian lands. In addition, it is contrary to international law to even use this landfill for the disposal of hazardous wastes. According to the Oslo Accords, hazardous waste in the Occupied Palestinian Territory needs to be transported for appropriate disposal to an Israeli landfill because the respective Palestinian authorities have been restricted from developing an appropriate location for environmentally sound disposal of toxic wastes. \nIn response to Palestine\u2019s notification, Israel claimed that the waste was not theirs because it came from an industrial settlement. However, since responsibility for hazardous waste under the convention extends to \u2018areas of jurisdiction\u2019, this claim was dismissed by the Secretariat. According to the Basel Convention, a \u201ctransboundary movement\u201d of waste entails the movement of waste from \u201can area under the national jurisdiction of one State\u201d to another.  Areas of national jurisdiction include \u201cany land, marine area or airspace within which a State exercises administrative and regulatory responsibility in accordance with international law in regard to the protection of human health or the environment\u201d.  Israeli settlements are under full Israeli control as Israeli civil legislation regulates settlements authority institutions and applies extraterritorially to individual Israeli settlers. \nFollowing the mediated negotiation process provided by the Basel Convention Secretariat, Palestine succeeded in winning an agreement from Israel for the waste to be transferred back across the Green Line, to be appropriately disposed of in Israel. This is a significant victory for Palestine, demonstrating one possible way to use international environmental law to hold Israel accountable for violating the environmental and human rights of Palestinians and seek appropriate remedies.

Also we call on the Ingonyama Trust Board to intervene as the trustees of our tribal land and ensure that the needs and rights of the affected communities are considered and parotected.\nThe demonstration is to make it clear to the corrupt leadership and authorities that enough is enough. Ibutho Coal we do not want to see you back on our land.\nMining is not development. No matter how much the government tries to push the lie that mining creates jobs for the local communities or that the people living close to mines benefit., we know otherwise because already we are living close to Tendele's Somkhele coal mine. \nWe know from regular contact with the Somkhele communities and other mining affected communities in Mpumalanga and Limpopo that mining brings death and suffering; steals our agricultural and grazing land; pollutes air and water; poisons the soil; splits communities apart; shatters the peace of rural living with explosions; cracks our houses; breaks our windows; brings suffering to our old people, children and our livestock; and only benefits already wealthy shareholders and directors but leaves local people impoverished. It also If living next to mining is so beneficial, we wonder why rich privileged people do not decide to relocate their homes and families to eMahleni? \nWe are feeling the effects of coal-related climate change and so strongly oppose the continued use and extraction of fossil fuels. The devastating drought here in Fuleni is expected to occur more frequently and become more extreme yet the government is agreeing to thirsty coal mines stealing our water, another constitutional right we are being robbed of.\nWe stand together with MACUA, GET, CCS \u2013 UKZN, groundWork, WoMin, EarthLore, the Amadiba Crisis Committee, the Mpukinyoni Community Property Association (MPCA), Yes to Life No to Mining, The Gaia Foundation, Grrrowd, and many other support organisations to demand: \n- The dissolution of the existing Traditional Council because of the high level of corruption amongst the majority of traditional leaders and their lack of interest in the needs of the people, and replaced with councillors who are concerned about the well-being of the Mthethwa communities and have our best interests at heart; \n- Nothing about us and our land without us; \n- No form of mining in Fuleni, specifically coal mining, fracking, marble mining. No government will convince us that we will benefit from mining or that it will improve our lives. We know that mining equals death. We do not want to experience the same bloodshed on our land as at Marikana and at Xolobeni because the Department of Mineral Resources is so willing to open doors to exploitative investors who not only destroy the environment but split communities apart; \n- Free access to information and freedom of speech as enshrined in the Constitution.

This right would be supported by\n\u2014 unrestricted right to clean seed\n\u2014 unrestricted right to store seed\n\u2014 unrestricted right to prepare seed for planting, including applying seed treatments\n\u2014 unrestricted establishment of new seed cleaning plants\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014 unrestricted access to seed cleaning equipment and parts.\n- Seed cleaning operations are an integral part of the seed system and thus\n\u2014 shall not be prosecuted\u00a0\u00a0for the cleaning of protected varieties for a third party\n\u2014 cannot be compelled to give out their client lists.\n- Plant breeders rights legislation that would confer the right to claim royalties only at the time of\nseed sale.

This system would make distinctions in requirements for varieties to be used in conventional or organic production when necessary. Such a system would:\n\u2014 ensure that varieties remain in the public domain following the expiration of plant breeders\u2019 rights;\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014 allow varieties to be registered under a general public license to ensure that such varieties remain freely available to farmers and public plant breeders;\n\u2014 prohibit cancellation of varieties by the variety registrant;\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014 allow the cancelling of registration for varieties only if evidence, including input from Recommending Committees, supported the cancellation;\n\u2014 have an accessible public appeal mechanism regarding registration and deregistration of varieties to support the public interest. For example, to prevent the registration of unwanted genetically modified varieties; to maintain registration of older varieties;\n\u2014 require robust, independent third\u2010party merit testing for new varieties to ensure they are as good as or better than existing varieties, which takes into account market harm, ecological impacts, multiple farming systems, nutrition, disease resistance and other\nrelevant factors;\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014 formally recognize the value of land races that are not intended to have uniformity and stability as defining characteristics, establishing mechanisms to allow\u00a0\u00a0heritage plant varieties such as Red Fife Wheat to be utilised in appropriate rotations and markets\u00a0\u00a0\n- A dispute settlement process that uses due process that would ensure\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 inspection and sampling would be done only with the farmer\u2019s explicit permission and in the presence of, and verified by, a qualified neutral third party.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 binding arbitration carried out by a public commission would settle questions of infringement, etc. between farmers and companies.

The judge acknowledged that the Project will desecrate the mountain and decrease the tribal members spiritual fulfillment from their religion. However, the judge found that the significant financial costs of the injunction outweighed these religious factors. Following this ruling, Barrick began project construction. \nOn 6 February 2009 the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs requested the appeals court to issue a preliminary injunction staying further ground disturbance and construction of the Project. Furthermore, the plaintiffs explained that they did not seek to disturb those parts of the Project that would not affect Mt. Tenabo, allowing Barrick to continue with the planned expansion approximately 8 miles away from the mountain. On 3 December 2009 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction to halt the expansion of the Cortez Gold Mine. The judge granted the injunction on the basis that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on their claims regarding environmental violations under the National Environmental Policy Act. In January 2010, Barrick filed a motion with the court proposing an amended injunction in order to allow Barrick to continue with limited operation of the Project. In February 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court requesting that it issue a full injunction to halt the Project. In June 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the lower courts dismissal of the case on two claims, and remanding the case to the lower court for further proceedings on the third claim regarding alleged violations under the National Environmental Policy Act. In October 2011 lawyers for Barrick Gold and lawyers for the Bureau of Land Management asked the judge presiding of the case to lift the partial injunction.

{"suggested_alternatives":"The NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on the governments in ship-owning countries (in particular: the EU and its Member States, Japan, China, Singapore, and the US) to prohibit the export of end-of-life vessels to South Asian shipbreaking countries as long as:\n- end-of-life vessels contain significant amounts of hazardous waste;\n- the shipbreaking countries cannot prove that all hazardous waste is removed, stored, treated, disposed or destructed in an environmantally sound manner;\n- working and living conditions of shipbreaking workers remain inadequate;\n- shipbreaking does not take place in modern ship recycling facilities off the beach with minimum technical and infrastructural requirements allowing for the containment of pollutions and workers\u2019 health and safety.\nThe NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its members call on ship owner to only sell their end-of-life vessels to modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. By 2016, it is expected that the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards globally. The Platform will be recommending the use of these yards to ship owners.\nThe NGO Shipbreaking Platform and its member organisations in Bangladesh recommend the following actions to the Government of Bangladesh, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:\n- The Government needs to close down all shipbreaking yards which do not operate in accordance with the Supreme Court rulings, operate without Environmental Clearances based on the assessment of their performance, or operate illegally on forest land, where mangrove trees have been cut illegally.  \n- The Government must ensure that yard owners are held responsible for severe injures and deaths resulting from a lack of adequate infrastructe, equipment, oversight or training. So far, no yard owner has been held responsible for their negligence and breach of the law.\n- The Government needs to ensure that no child or adolescent workers under the age of 18 work in the shipbreaking yards. Yards in which workers under 18 are found, need to be sanctioned and eventually closed down if illegal child labour is not stopped. The shipbreaking sector must be taken into account in the Government\u2019s strategy to eradicate worst forms of child labour.\n- The Government together with the relevant local authorities should develop and implement a \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb, that is, a cross-departmental policy to allow for the much needed shift towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention, the ILO and the IMO.\n- The Government should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure to develop modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. \n- The \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer and environmentally sound methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).\n- The Government of Bangladesh should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia \u2013 India and Pakistan \u2013 in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a \u2018level playing field\u2019 is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.\n- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Supreme Court rulings and obligations under international law, the Government needs to develop sector-specific shipbreaking rules. The new regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between different government agencies at the national and local level and needs to clearly define the competent authorities\u2019 roles.\n- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention (in particular Prior Informed Consent and Environmentally Sound Management of hazardous wastes) as well as the standards set out in the new EU Ship Recycling Regulation.\n- The new regulation needs to set out the authorisation criteria for facilities, to establish a set of rules for facility operation, including the procedures to obtain permits for different kinds of hazardous work, clearly define which authority needs to issue certificates and approvals, and set up an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation\u2019s requirements.\n- With regards to hazardous waste management, the \u201cGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u201d needs to include a plan to establish: a reception facility for operationally and non-operationally generated waste at a port close to the yards with a mandatory port call for all imported end-of-life vessels to perform cleaning activities such as cleaning cargo tanks, emptying bilge tanks, paint and chemical stores, and unloading waste oil and surplus fuel, waste storage on the yards, waste reception facilities such as a sanitary landfill, disposal treatment facility for hazardous waste such as PCBs, a system to track hazardous waste and to avoid the repartition into the market, establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.\n- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should provide a training center and seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training. Adequate training must be a pre-requirement for work in the shipbreaking yards. Workers needs to be handed out certificates and training efforts needs to be documented.\n- With regards to workers\u2019 rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, the immediate improvement of workers\u2019 living conditions including drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.\n- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a new draft law on asbestos safety.\n- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary (for instance in the local Labour Court). Compliance needs to be monitored especially with regards to: workers\u2019 registration for social benefits, provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), application of environmental, health and safety procedures, use of obligatory on-site pollution control and safety gadgets, periodic monitoring of maintenance and improvements of on-site equipment, provision of sufficient, improved and satisfactory on-site health care system, adequate training status of workers and awareness of hazards, maintenance of hazardous waste inventory and disposal.\n- The Government of Bangladesh should ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, thus prohibit the import of hazardous waste, and the Hong Kong Convention and seek early compliance with the provisions under the latter. Moreover, the Government should enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention and seek guidance also from the EU Ship Recycling Regulation's standards for ship recycling facilities.\n- The Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify \u201chot spots\u201d that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations\u2019 expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense and the Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.\n- The Government needs to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking. They need to allow for transparency and enhance civil society involvement. Moreover, they should embrace the active participation of trade unions and promote their independent and democratic structures.","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"Significant decisions towards environmental and social protection have been taken by the Supreme Court in Bangladesh. Several imports of vessels have been stopped by the Courts on the grounds that Bangladesh should not import toxic wastes.

In 2014 some of the yards situated where 14 000 mangrove trees were illegaly cut were eveicted and the Courts also ordered the replanting of the trees. The court ordered the consolidation of laws relevant for shipbreaking in line with both environmantal protection and workers' rights. \nHowever, most of the court's orders have been ignored by both the Government and the industry. \nThe Bangladeshi ship breaking industry remains a hazardous industry for both workers and the environment.  Since 2009 most yards have been able to re-open based on environmental permits with extended deadlines for complience with relevant environmental requirements. Though illegal by Bangladesh law, children still make up about 20% of the workforce. Bangladesh remains the second most favoured destination for ship owners looking for maximum profits when selling their old ships.  \nSo far little attention has been given to the sector by governmental agencies.\nDue to the lack of adequate technology and equipment as well as deficient law enforcement, proper waste handling procedures are not followed. So far, the sector can neither prevent pollution and the distribution of hazardous materials into the local market nor mitigate the risks of accidents and occupational diseases.\nThere is still no hazardous waste management system for the shipbreaking yards in Bangladesh. Hazardous waste store houses are empty and not in use. There is no asbestos landfil, no waste treatment facility, such as an incinerator for PCBs, and the yards do not have water treatment plants.

Dorothy's tireless work for the rights of the dispossessed and the protection of the Amazon rainforest stood in the way of the profits of logging and cattle ranching.

Last July I had the opportunity to go to Brazil and walk the same roads Sister Dorothy walked in her last days, to walk with the people for whom she lived and died. Over 200 people took part in this 10th pilgrimage: families and friends who knew Dorothy, youth groups, university students and professors, priests and sisters from many dioceses and religious congregations, journalists, environmentalists, young and old. As each day began, we gathered to sing and pray, to listen to Scripture, and to ponder questions that connected the ongoing struggle for justice to our lives of faith.

On the contrary, the situation got worsened and vast land of the project area covered under polder 24 comprising 27 beels (large depression area) and at least 144 villages in the Abhaynagar, Keshabpur and Monirampur Upazilla started experiencing unprecedented water logging for indefinite period as natural drainage channels got silted and the sluice gates set up under the projects lost efficacy due to increased siltation and evidently no effective dredging.\nIn 1997, local people introduced a process called Tidal River Management (TRM) and tested the same in Keshabpur under Jessore. Under TRM approach, tidal water enters only in one tidal basin developed in a suitable beel with dykes and closures and deposits huge amount of silt that fills the bed of the beel in 3-4 years. They removed embankment encircling the Beel Bhaina in Keshabpur to allow tidal flow of water into the beel area. The TRM introduced by local people significantly reduced the water logging problem in Keshabpur and helped raising the land level of the beel with siltation. \nThis approach enhanced the scope for mitigating drainage congestion and people recommended that new TRM should be established every 3-4 years on a rotating basis to ensure that water congestion of all areas are resolved by raising level of beel areas through sedimentation. \nUnfortunately, adamant position of BWDB against interference with existing structures and absence of firm commitment from the government agencies to pay compensation to land owners whose lands shall be under water for at least three years to allow TRM led to no agreements on TRM in new areas including in beel Khukshia, Kapalia and Baruna. \nAs water logging took a severe form in 2005, local people started writing to the government actors to remove water from their villages, homestead, academic institutions, roads and all other infrastructure and also to protect their lives, properties, safety and health from the curse of such water logging attributable solely due to the unplanned structural interventions of KJDRP and other previous projects.

The demands from the people were considered in a meeting on 25.11.2005 that in the presence of three concerned members of Parliament decided that the situation would be handled on an emergency basis like war situation and that siltation from Sree-Hari-Teka rivers would be removed to drain out water to enable people to cultivate boro crop.

The presiding judge the Honorable Denis Jacques rejected Strateco's claim of $182,684,575 for the loss of its investment in the Matoush uranium project and an additional $10 million in punitive damages. This decision by the SCQ was undoubtedly a major win for environmentalists and First Nations advocates, as it set a precedent future mining companies trying to extract financial compensation from a development project after a government moratorium. However, the moratorium on uranium mining in Quebec can still be revoked by a simply change in government or public policy, as the court did not rule on the legality of the moratorium remaining in-place indefinitely. As a result, until a law is passed by the Quebec National Assembly (which is unlikely) then uranium mining in Northern Quebec and at the Matoush Project near Mistissini still has the possibility of being revived at a future date. In the meantime, the residents in the nearby Cree community of Mistissini will be left to worry about the ultimate fate of this massive (now abandoned) uranium project in their backyard.\n \nAt the same time this verdict was reached by the Superior Court of Quebec, the James Bay Cree First Nation groups used the opportunity to mention the many other mining activities still occurring in their region outside of uranium. In Northern Quebec, exploratory mining and industrial development is extensive, including other valuable minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron ore, zinc, lead, and chromium. Other mining activities such as these have been increasing despite the moratorium on uranium mining, which is only a small fraction of Northern Quebec\u2019s mining activities. As a result of the Plan Nord instituted by Premier Jean Charest, northern mining and industrial development is proceeding more rapidly than ever before, to the detriment of the local ecology and boreal species. Therefore, the temporary moratorium imposed on uranium mining only halted a small niche development in the Quebec mining sector, while far more important and extensive activities continue to expand unchecked. This is why the moratorium on uranium is seen by aboriginals as simply a bandage being applied to a fatal wound, as other mining sectors only increase their presence and impact on their environment.

It must not be a simple calculation of the value of the timber or one year\u2019s production. (In Bahasa Indonesia they are demanding ganti untung -opportunity costs - rather than ganti rugi \u2013 compensation).\nRecognition of indigenous land rights. This means that the practice of taking local people\u2019s land without their direct consent must stop. HSL\/CDC must not use the local authorities to procure land (at least until democracy at village and district levels is fully implemented under recent local autonomy legislation).\nA new agreement must be signed with local communities for the use of their customary (adat) lands over the 25 year period which the plantation permit covers.\nPayment of fines determined by customary law for the desecration of graves.\nA stop to burning by the company in and around its concession, whether this is to clear land for plantation, to control weeds or to prevent encroachment.\nFull transparency about the way the plantation co-operative scheme operates, including its advantages and disadvantages and the financial and other responsibilities of participation. This is essential for local people to be able to make an informed decision about whether to take part.\nAll people who have given up land and who decide, after being properly informed, that they want to participate in the KKPA scheme must be allocated plots.

This must be a top-quality investigation \u2013 not something done on the cheap to assuage critics \u2013 using participatory methods. The terms of reference should be agreed with the indigenous community.\nThe recommendations of the audit must be discussed openly with the whole community and implemented on a schedule to be agreed with the community.\nSet up an appeals procedure to deal with further disputes or disagreements over the settlement of present grievances.

{"suggested_alternatives":"According to Beril Ocakl\u0131 (6), one can compare the behaviour of mining companies as follows: \"In the case of the Taldy-Bulak Levoberezhny gold mine in Orlovka, the license-holder has since 2011 been a Chinese one, namely Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. In 2012-2013, following a series of protests by local residents, the Chinese operator endorsed a rather partnership-oriented approach to the community. They signed an agreement with the local administration to ensure investment in social infrastructure, a hiring quota, and environmental monitoring in adherence with the legal framework. After acquiring the social license to operate, however, it became less important to implement the agreement and take the people\u2019s concerns into account. Today, there is no trace of the openness that we saw before the company received Orlovka\u2019s consent. Different segments of society are now working together to access information about the mining plans and to monitor environmental and labor practices. Unfortunately, we do not hear much about the ongoing resistance in Orlovka in the media and public discourse._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn another example, namely the Shambesai gold concession in the Maidan rural community in Batken, the initial mine developer, Z-Explorer was a subsidiary of Australia-based gold developer Manas Resources. The company discovered gold reserves in 2007 and acquired three licenses to prospect, explore, and develop the deposit from 2005 to 2012\u2014all without the communities\u2019 knowledge. People in Maidan did not know who had licensed 87 hectares of their pasture to whom and why. It was only after violent clashes in October 2013, as they brought in the first excavator to start the construction phase, that the company started to engage with the community, putting a lot of effort into outreach\u2014perhaps more than the Chinese operator in Orlovka did in its quest for a social license. It was, however, already too late for Maidan._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThus, the question is what \u201copenness\u201d means and how and when it is performed by the companies.

Esto se debe tanto a los vac\u00edos legales para controlar, se\u00f1alar e imputar a empresas estatales longevas como estas, como a la propia complicidad de las instituciones del Estado, que se han hecho y se hacen la vista gorda ante la problem\u00e1tica.

{"suggested_alternatives":"The biggest alternative being proposed is green harvesting. The Sierra Club's \"Stop the Burn Campaign\" is a huge advocate of green harvesting replacing pre-harvest burns. Green harvesting has become a predominant practice around the world [1]. Brazil, Australia, Cuba, and Zimbabwe all used to rely on pre-harvest burns to harvest sugarcane but they have successfully switched over to green harvesting. This has created a very profitable market for sugarcane trash [1]. If the US sugar industry continues to use outdated practices they are missing out on profitable opportunities. The demand for organic sugar cane and clean renewable biomass energy (such as sugarcane ethanol, biodiesel, and biochar) will only continue to grow [1]. Green harvesting is presenting Big Sugar to \u201ccreate new green jobs and contribute to a new era of prosperity for the Glades\u201d [1].  _x000D_\nMany other environmental organizations, including the Everglades Coalition, propose a 27-30 mile buffer around the impacted communities, which includes South Bay, Belle Glade, and Pahokee.

While there the class-action lawsuit is in process, this case exemplifies the power a well-established industry has. The sugar industry generously contributes to elected officials and candidates in public office, as well as funding pervasive lobbying operations, making it difficult to hold them responsible and accountable [12].  In October 2019, Commissioner Fried announced what \u201c she said were the first major changes to sugarcane burning regulations in nearly three decades\u201d [3]. In August 2020, Fried announced the second phase intends to implement a training program for burners and revise the zones set up in the 1990s [3].  The changes are targeted to \u201creduce [the] potential smoke impact to all communities\u201d and the revisions are planning to take effect in January 2021 [3]. However, the Sierra Club argues the changes do not fully protect the Florida residents living in the Glades [3]. Fried and the FDACS continue to drag their feet about holding the sugar industry accountable and keeping the residents in western Palm Beach County and the surrounding Glades area safe [3].

{"suggested_alternatives":"A proposal brought about for combating this project is an inspection of the City\u2019s 600,000 linear feet of sewers. This would determine what portions need to be fixed, and even if the entire system needs to be replaced. Surprisingly, the City of Mount Vernon has already started this process, inspecting 10,000 linear feet of sewers. While a promising start, the advancements on the project have since halted and no real change has been initiated. In order for the remaining 590,000 linear feet of sewer lines to be inspected in an 18 to 24 month span, the City would need to invest in a qualified crew and new equipment. The cost of a Department of Public Works crew of four people and new equipment would cost the city a total of $850,000 USD. Investments into both a Commissioner of Community Planning and Development as well as a City Engineer will also be necessary. The neighboring cities of New Rochelle and Yonkers each pay these positions upwards of $100,000 annually. The estimated cost of the remaining portion of sewer left to inspect as well as positions that need to be filled is about $1,836,000. However, after subtracting grants as well as vacancy savings, the net total cost of this project would be $122,000 [10].

After more than a decade, cleanup workers and their families have yet to have their substantive claims adjudicated and it is possible that the Tennessee Supreme Court will find that state law bars many, if not all, of the workers\u2019 claims. Further, Tennessee has a tort claims statute which caps the financial recovery for personal injury, pain and suffering; these caps are likely below the medical costs already incurred by the workers and will not begin to cover the lifetime medical costs incurred by them and their families to monitor and treat their conditions. More fundamentally, over 50 cleanup workers have died since being exposed to the toxic coal ash [14]. No amount of financial compensation or policy changes will be sufficient justice for them and their families. More broadly, the TVA spent an estimated $1.2 billion to clean up the spill and turn the area into a public park, but significant contamination of water resources remains [28].

The EIA process involves an evaluation of the potential environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed project, as well as the identification of potential measures to mitigate or offset these impacts. If the coastal road project is found to be in violation of these regulations, it could be subject to legal action and potentially face penalties or fines. On the other hand, if the project is found to be in compliance with existing regulations and environmental laws, it could proceed, although there may still be opposition from environmental groups or local communities who feel that the project poses a significant risk to the island's fragile ecosystem. However compliance with regulations and environmental laws does not necessarily mean that a project will not have negative impacts on the environment or on local communities. The EIAs themselves are often criticized for not adequately taking into account the cumulative impacts of multiple development projects, or for being overly influenced by the interests of project proponents. As a result, compliance with regulations and environmental laws is not a guarantee that the project will be sustainable or environmentally responsible._x000D_\n_x000D_\nNegotiated alternative solution: It is possible that stakeholders could agree to an alternative solution that addresses the concerns of all parties, such as a modified version of the coastal road or an alternative transportation plan. In the case of the coastal road project in La R\u00e9union, there have been proposals by environmental justice organizations and other stakeholders for alternative approaches to transportation infrastructure that could mitigate the impacts of the proposed road. For example, some groups have advocated for the development of public transportation systems, such as light rail or bus rapid transit, that would reduce the need for individual vehicles and alleviate traffic congestion. Other proposals have included investment in renewable energy technologies, which could reduce the island's dependence on fossil fuels and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenpeace, for instance, has called for the implementation of sustainable and low-carbon transportation systems that prioritize public transportation and non-motorized transportation options, such as walking and cycling. Greenpeace has also called for the implementation of renewable energy solutions, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels. While the development of alternatives may face challenges, such as funding and political opposition, they represent an opportunity to shift away from traditional approaches to transportation infrastructure development and towards more sustainable and environmentally responsible solutions.

{"suggested_alternatives":"In interviews conducted with local residents, suggested alternatives to the mining project included the expansion of the tourism sector, agriculture, fisheries and fish processing [16]. However, interviews also showed the reluctance of local residents to invest in developing these alternative initiatives as long as there was uncertainty around the outcome of the mining project [16]._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn a joint press release published by environmental organisation \u2018NOAH\u2019, a speaker for the organisation \u2018Sustainable Energy\u2019 (\u2018Vedvarende Energy\u2019) highlighted that alternative mining projects would be possible in nearby locations such as Killavaat Alannguat\/Kringlerne [33]. Here REE deposits have also been discovered and could be extracted without uranium as a bi-product and the consequent risk of nuclear waste pollution [33].","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"An evaluation of the EJ issues in the case of the Kuannersuit project must be understood in light of the country\u2019s socio-economic background, and more specifically with an understanding of the community in Narsaq. There are differing voices in the debate on natural resource extraction in Greenland, creating what Hansen et al. (2013) have described as environmental and ethical dilemmas [16]. Many business leaders, politicians and Greenlanders view natural resource extraction and mining activities as a means to boost economic activity and create employment [38]. With more and more young people emigrating from the island in search of further education or employment and Greenland seeking greater financial independence from Denmark, mineral exploitation is regarded as a way to help mitigate these issues and this has become one of the dominant if not the most dominant discourse around mining [2, 17]. The Greenlandic government is therefore actively encouraging new large-scale mining projects [3], of which the Kuannersuit REE-Uranium project has become one of the most divisive mining projects in Greenland to date. However, the ability to gain financial independence from Denmark on the basis of mining has also been questioned given the size of Danish subsidies, emphasising the continued importance of the fishing, hunting and agricultural industries [39]. In Narsaq, the town is experiencing increased emigration, and there is a general consensus from residents both opposing and supporting the project that something needs to change in order for the town to \u2018survive\u2019 [16, 17]. With both support and opposition existing among locals living close to the proposed project site in Narsaq [16], it is therefore difficult to evaluate what outcome would be considered a success for the community. One survey conducted by WWF found that 53% of survey participants from the Southern Greenland region supported uranium mining in general [29]. However, on the basis of one survey referring to uranium mining generally and not specifically interviewing local residents, these results cannot be held equivalent to opinions on the Kuannersuit project. Many local residents of Narsaq and nearby areas have mobilised against the project in demonstrations and signed petitions faced with the risk of nuclear pollution (see account of mobilisations above). It is important to note that local residents opposing the Kuannersuit project are not necessarily against mining in general, as the debate around Kuannersuit is highly focused on the question of uranium [16]. However, central to the debate around the controversial project has been the question of whether public consultation has been adequate [26, 27]. The view that public consultation needs to be improved in the environmental and social impact assessments is shared by local residents in Narsaq and nearby Qaqortoq both in favour and opposed to the project [16]. The lack of appropriate public consultation and engagement is a clear issue of procedural injustice and improvements are being demanded by local populations not only in the Kuannersuit project but also in other mining projects across the country [16, 18, 26, 38]. The short public consultation period and bias of information sessions regarding the project as well as the lack of transparency on issues of compensation are amongst some of the issues that are being raised. Furthermore, fieldwork conducted by Hansen and Johnstone (2019) in southern Greenland shows how some local residents in Narsaq felt that the debate around the Kuannersuit project was being directed by strong external actors and polarised between international environmental NGOs on the one side and the mining company on the other [16]. Interviews with local residents conducted by Bj\u00f8rst (2016) also pointed to two dominant discourses around this project; on the one hand the mining sector \u2018saving\u2019 the community (creating jobs etc.) and benefiting Greenlandic economy, and on the other NGOs arguing that the project will \u2018destroy\u2019 the community and environment [17]. They consequently felt marginalised in these competing agendas, which points to serious limitations in procedural justice. In addition to this, there have been calls from environmental organisations and the Greenlandic party IA to hold a referendum on uranium mining, but so far these have not been met [28]. Altogether, these issues indicate serious EJ concerns and point to the project so far being an EJ defeat. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nFrom the perspective of environmental organisations Urani Naamik (No to Uranium, Greenland), NOAH (Friends of the Earth Denmark), Avataq, \u2018Det \u00d8kologiske R\u00e5d\u2019 (The Ecological Council), \u2018Vedvarende Energy\u2019 (\u2018Sustainable Energy\u2019), Nuup Kangerluata Ikinngutai (\u2018Friends of Nuuk Fjord\u2019), the political party IA, local residents in opposition and sheepfarmers - who have shown opposition to the Kuannersuit project on environmental justice grounds - the approval of the Kuannersuit project would likely be deemed an EJ defeat.

The following options were considered and the Kanjurmarg option was recommended by the committee. \nFirst option is backbay which has a reservation. There is no issue there, it\u2019s a reserved plot of land and meant for this facility.\nSecond one is a port trust land. Port trust lands run into 100 acres or more. 100s of acres of land is available at the car park. It\u2019s a land which is not being used, there are defunct or abandoned godowns there and it is the best place for locating this because the tree cover is very minimal and the damage would be very less.\nThird option is mahalaxmi race course. Mahalaxmi race course was handed over to the MMRDA to be used for the metro car shed but they chose to withdraw from the mahalaxmi car shed for reasons best known to them and they came to aarey. The reason given by the MMRCA was that the race course had a heritage structure on it. The heritage structure is a spectators stand which is a grade three heritage structure. Horse racing has stopped and there is enough open land next to it. Yet, they did not use it. The lease for the horse racing has expired and the land is available to the government. And the basic fact remains that this land was given to them and they chose to walk out of it.\nFourth Option is BKC. MMRCL refused point blank to consider it saying that it is high real estate. This must be the only country in the world where a land with 4000 trees on it next to river is less precious than a land that has no trees on it. The land at BKC is barren \u2013 there are no trees on it and most importantly it is in the custody of MMRDA.\nFifth option was kalina university. Kalina university has enough land which is lying unused since the past two decades. It has been encroached by slums and there are vested interests at play that are trying to grab that land. Interestingly, this land was also sought and accepted as an option in the project report. Now kalina \u2013 they are saying that the land is not sufficient. There is more than 25 hectares of land available at kalina.\nSixth option is dharavi. It\u2019s a huge slum \u2013 massive property which has to be eventually redeveloped \u2013 all alum dwellers need to be re settled. They cant be living in filth all their lives \u2013 it has been part of the government\u2019s plan for many years now. Moving the slum dwellers and locating the car shed there would benefit everyone.\nSeventh option There is enough land inside SEEPZ, inside the MIDC for this car shed. Its very visible \u2013 they have not considered that.\nEighth Option Now the most viable and most available land is the kanjurmarg dumping grounds. Kanjurmarg is an abandoned salt pan which does not receive any tide water for the last 15 years. The land is barren hard and it is available.\nKanjurmarg has more than 250 acres of land \u2013 enough to accommodate a metro shed and a complete transport hub.

However, the developments to date point to clear EJ limitations. The Inuit Circumpolar Council are amongst those who have criticised the lack of debate over mining development in Greenland, as Naalakkersuisut quickly opened up to foreign mining companies and investment upon gaining self-rule, marginalising the consultation on large-scale projects such as Isua [24]. Local consultation in the mining process has arguably been made more difficult following a structural shift in the municipalities of Greenland in 2009, where the decision was made to join 18 municipalities into four large ones spanning over huge geographical areas [5]. In the Isua case, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and Avataq have both argued for an improved public consultation process. The lack of appropriate public consultation therefore points to serious procedural justice issues with the Isua project and indicate it so far having EJ limitations. Another EJ issue in this case is the dilemma resulting from differing ideas of ownership rights over land and resources in Greenland. People mobilising against the project and EJ organisations have pointed to the contradictions between the collective land use in the area of the proposed Isua mine as a traditional hunting area, and the exclusive exploitation rights granted to private mining companies by the government [3]. However, with an overall pro-mining stance in Greenland at the prospect of economic prosperity and jobs, evaluating what outcome would be considered a success for the community is difficult. Results from past public hearings have pointed to the Isua mine being an opportunity for both direct and indirect employment and development of local businesses, alongside education and training opportunities [5]. However, with the controversial \u2018Large Scale Project Act\u2019 (\u2018Storskalaloven\u2019) easing the ability to bring international labour to work on large-scale projects, the beneficial social impacts on the local community are not certain to become a reality [6]._x000D_\nAltogether, these issues point to serious limitations with procedural justice in this case.

{"suggested_alternatives":"KCC is currently involved in numerous activities centered around livelihood generation and sustainable ecotourism, such as:  \n-\tVillage homestays \nWith the aim of encouraging sustainable tourism facilities and creating opportunities for the villagers to earn economic benefits, KCC started promoting Village Homestays. Along with offering services which are efficient and environmental friendly services such as fuel-efficient cooking and heating, and hygienic indigenous composting toilets (Chettri et al, 2008), the homestay practice also encourages cultural and environmental conservation by providing an opportunity to strengthen the local culture and tradition in terms of hospitality, use of decor, cuisine, and buildings (Chettri et al, 2008) and enables cultural exchange between the villagers and the outsiders. \nAs of 2017, KCC has helped train around 400 homestay operators by selecting lower income family members who can benefit from additional income and women for whom financial empowerment would be valuable. KCC handles all of the marketing and booking requirements and also provides a range of hospitality-based training for homestay owners. For example, homestay owners are given the opportunity to participate in cooking, housekeeping and financial management training. \n An important contribution of KCC\u2019s work has been the establishment of a minimum room tariff for homestays. This emerged from fears of potential exploitation of homestay owners who were arm-twisted into lowering their room tariffs to unsustainable levels. This occurred more so because of competition from large hotels and resorts. Through KCC\u2019s facilitation, all homestay owners now request a nightly tariff of Rs 2500.\n-\t Zero Waste Trekking  \nKCC formed a participatory monitoring programme of the trekking trail inside KNP and in the surrounding areas. KCC identified and invited key local people and national park staff from the village for a general consultation meeting. The goals of the monitoring process were discussed and with consultation of the village member\u2019s consensus was arrived at about participating in the proposed programme. Consultation and assistance from external agencies such as the Forest department and Sikkim tourism department were sought to make an effective work plan that would address the issues of monitoring tourism activities and conservation impacts. Having set their targets, several meetings were conducted in the village to make local people and those involved in tourism enterprises aware as to why such an initiative was important and how local people could participate and contribute. \nObjectives of the monitoring programme:\n 1. Monitoring the status of waste, condition of trekking trails and campsite facilities over the trekking routes \n2. Monitoring the prohibition of use of firewood and other forest products by trekkers, trek operators and their support staff \n3. Involve tourists, trekkers and local tourism operators in the monitoring process\nAnnually, the monitoring programs helps in collection of around 800 kg of waste from the trekking trails and the forests. KCC now operates a functional Waste Segregation Centre and has worked with the Forest Department to create a system by which trekking operators have to declare non bio-degradable waste products through that are being carried through a checklist and upon return account for these products. Defaulters are fined a hefty sum of Rs.5000 if they fail to account for waste that was not brought back.\nWaste material like noodle packets, tetra packs, plastic etc. are recycled to make fashionable handbags, pillows, notebooks and so on that tourists can buy when the visit the KCC office. Yuksam was the first village in Sikkim to ban the use of plastic (both bags and bottles) in 1996 and the Government of Sikkim has since implemented this throughout the state. KCC also implemented and encouraged trekking companies to adopt a prohibition on the use of firewood during treks. Currently, all trekking groups are required to carry kerosene stoves (also monitored pre and post trek).  \nConnected to low-impact trekking trails is the introduction and widespread use of dzos instead of yaks, which is a move that KCC strongly encouraged in the 1990s. This came out of numerous surveys that showed the adverse grazing impacts of yaks as compared to dzos (a hybrid between yaks and domestic cows).\n-\t Ecotourism Service Providers Association of Yuksam (ESPAY) \nESPAY (Ecotourism Service Providers Association of Yuksam) is an association that KCC initiated in 2004 to provide capacity building to trekking guides, dzo and yak owners, porters and other ecotourism-related professionals in Yuksom. As of 2017, KCC has trained more than 100 cooks through various training programs, around 250 naturalists guides, around 1000 porters and pack animal operators. ESPAY currently has 250 members has a range of different activities including: (a) lobbying at the state level for minimum living wages for porters and (b) community compensation scheme for loss of dzos due to trekking accidents and natural causes; and (c) provision of vaccinations and veterinary support for livestock\n-\tEnvironmental Education Activities\nThe KCC office is also an environmental education centre that tourists are encouraged to visit to learn about KNP and low-impact tourism. In 2005-6, KCC trained around 100 teachers on Environmental Education. From information about the wildlife that trekkers can encounter on trails to recycled trekking waste, the KCC centre remains accessible for all visitors to the area. However, given that visiting the Centre isn\u2019t mandatory for trekkers, bringing in all visitors continues to be a challenge","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"Challenges remain: \nKey challenge concerning urbanisation and sustainable development has been to come to village-level agreements. While KCC has been able to achieve a lot by engaging with individual homestay owners or dzo owners, bringing the village together to discuss issues continues to be a challenge. For example, trekking by itself is now zero-waste. However, commercial development in Yuksam town itself in the form of large hotels and allied facilities is not regularized. The Gram Sabha had at one point agreed to restrict infrastructure development to buildings of three floors only. However, it has been difficult to enforce this without a formal Gram Sabha resolution. Finally, with regards to the Waste Segregation Centre, while all trekking-related waste is being collected at a designated Centre, it has been challenging to find ways to recycle all of this waste material. KCC has managed to create some recycled products from this waste but a large amount of waste material remains at the Centre with no clear channels for what happens next.\nEnforcing and monitoring stringent trekking regulations has been challenging because of varying support from the Forest Department. Primarily, trekking occurs inside KNP and therefore, strictly enforcing regulations on collection of wildlife species and forest products and fuelwood use is still largely within the jurisdiction of the Departments\u2019 core activities. While KCC can push the Department to carry out patrolling and monitoring activities, these decisions are beyond the scope of KCC\u2019s influence.","success_level":"Not sure","name":"In operation","slug":"khangchendzonga-conservation-committee","id":5.0,"color":"#ee2c2c","project_status":null}

Shell denied any links between its operations and the harms to workers.  On appeal, the S\u00e3o Paulo Labour Court affirmed the lower court's ruling.  In March 2012 Shell and BASF were in settlement talks to determine who should pay the Brazilian damages.  In February 2013 the S\u00e3o Paulo Labour Court reported that Shell and BASF had offered the plaintiffs a settlement -- lifelong health plans for each, worth about US$26 million.  The parties agreed to a final settlement in March 2013 worth about 620 million reais (US$316 million).

In mid-2015, the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards, which responsible ship owners can use.\nThe NGO Shipbreaking Platform its member organisations in Bangladesh recommend the following actions to the Government of India, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:\n- The Government needs to close down all shipbreaking yards which do not operate in full accordance with the Supreme Court rulings and exisiting rules and regulations.\n- The Government must ensure that yard owners are held responsible for severe injures and deaths resulting from a lack of adequate infrastructe, equipment, oversight or training. So far, no yard owner has been held responsible for malpractice or negligence.\n- The Government together with the relevant local authorities should develop and implement a \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb, that is a cross-departmental policy to allow for the much needed change towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO.\n- The Government should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure to develop modern ship recycling facilities off the beach. \n- The \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).\n- The Government should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia \u2013 Bangladesh and Pakistan \u2013 in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a \u2018level playing field\u2019 is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.\n- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Supreme Court rulings and obligations under international law, the Government needs to develop the sector-specific shipbreaking rules. The regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between different government agencies at the national and local level and needs to clearly define the competent authorities\u2019 roles.\n- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention (in particular Prior Informed Consent, PIC, and Environmentally Sound Management, ESM, of hazardous wastes) as well as the future Hong Kong Convention.\n- The new regulation needs to set out an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation\u2019s requirements.\n- With regards to hazardous waste management, the \u201cGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u201d needs to include a solution for the destruction of PCBS (which is not yet possible in India), and a system to track hazardous waste to avoid illegal dumping or the repartition of hazardous materials into the market, the establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.\n- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training. A two day training is not sufficient for workers to work safely in a hazardous industry. Workers needs to be handed out certificates and training efforts needs to be documented.\n- With regards to workers\u2019 rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, the immediate improvement of workers\u2019 living conditions including drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.\n- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a new draft law on asbestos safety.\n- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary.

Moreover, the Government should enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention.\n- The Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify \u201chot spots\u201d that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations\u2019 expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense in Pakistan and Bangladesh and the Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.\n- The Government needs to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking.

By ignoring the question of wether or not doing the project, and already proposing an extension, the State did not set good trust conditions for the population. [12] Up to 15 900 people participated in the debate, and the Commission concluded that the only way to go forward with the project with the consent of the public was to push it foward outwards in the sea. While the public showed its adhesion to the objective of energetic transition, they did not think it was realistic with this project and were arguing in favor of energetic sobriety. They insisted on the poor choice of the area regarding biodiversity, the local economy (fishing, tourism) and the local heritage. Moreover, the CNDP adviced to have a spacial planification with a vision on 20 to 30 years to offer visibility to the local actors. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nFrom this debate emerged an alternative proposed by certains participants: a park of 1GW outside of the natural park and the coastal fishing zone (more than 20 miles), and then a second park more on the west with a mutualized connection. For the fiercest opponents to the project, settling outside the natural park does not eliminate the risks for migratory birds and other marine ecosystem on which there are less knowledge. For other, those hypothesis call for more research. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAnother question arising then was the cost, and if it would still be doable in a more remote area. The CNDP asked independant experts. They concluded that, taken into account that the offshore windmills technologies have been progressing very fast those past years,  a more remote park could be as competitive pricewise than a coastal one. A change to floating wind power should be considered from a certain distance from the coast. [12]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThus, the Commission adressed the following recommendation to the Minister of Ecology and the RTE: \"submit to the candidates for the future call for tenders a study area that is \"sufficiently large and extended further offshore\". This suggestion is a priori supported by a first \"technical exploration\" carried out by two consultancy firms, which it has called upon. The objective: to be able to envisage a wind farm outside the natural marine park and the coastal fishing zone [beyond the 20-mile limit of 70 metres in depth]. \"Without exploding the costs\", Francis Beaucire explains. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWhile a local representative in charge of animating the project said that this option will be taken into account, the State and RTE had until july 2022 to answer the observations of the CPDP and determine whether or not they launch competitive bidding for future developers. [14]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn the 27th of July 2022, the State announced there will be a first and then a second call for tenders for the installation of two wind farms of about 1,000 MW each off the island of Ol\u00e9ron. It has also revised its position on their location, and the nearest one to Ol\u00e9ron will be 40 kms distant, outside the natural park and coastal fishery zones.

The majority of teachers employed by KCLC are indigenous to Cochiti, ranging from elders to individuals in their twenties. These teachers encompass comprehensive cultural and academic lessons into one curriculum, giving students both the internal, traditional knowledge as well as preparing students with knowledge ranging from English to Math. KCLC works to restore Cochiti's lost culture as well as providing paid employment opportunities to the people of Cochiti [10]. Another alternative to the ongoing issue is the working relationship formed between the Army Corps of Engineers and Cochiti Pueblo","other_outcomes":"Today, the Pueblo de Cochiti is negotiating with a most unresponsive US government agency, the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE), in an effort to reclaim its land and culture from the troublesome Cochiti dam and lake.","success_reason":"Despite the progressive legislations passed and the mobilization of Cochiti Pueblo that is still being seen today, environmental justice has still not been served to the people and community of Cochiti Pueblo. Although Cochiti was able to reduce the proposed 40,000 Cochiti Lake Town residents to 600, this non-native town still currently exists and can never be eliminated [7]. _x000D_\nFurthermore, seeing that Cochiti Pueblo has a population of 528 people [3], Cochiti Lake Town has a larger population which maintains the fact that the people of Cochiti continue to be the minority of their own homelands. Consistent flooding and seepage issues from the dam continue to this day, resulting in the loss of the majority of Cochiti's farm land and farming culture [5]. Furthermore, the physical structure of the dam remains a constant, 5.5 mile long physical reminder of how the United States treats indigenous communities; Gene Ka-hee explains how this dam \"... stretches an irreversible shadow across our land.\u201d In addition to all these injustices that still have not been solved, the future of Cochiti Pueblo remains unknown and burdened onto the people of Cochiti.

Due to the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 neglect in creating a plan for the future of Cochiti Dam, this became Cochiti Pueblo's responsibility.

The well-know success of the Ingo River in suspending 36 out of 37 mining licenses and the resulting credibility was in jeopardy as new mining licences were issued and the revoke ones reclaimed. These changes led some members of the HWPC to undertake direct action at gold mine sites and to adopt radical tactics to draw public and government attention to the problem.\" [1]_x000D_\n_x000D_\n\"The United Movement of Mongolian Rivers and Lakes, led by the leader of the Ongi River Movement, (...) played a leading role in the formation of the Environmental Citizens' Council (ECC) in 2008, the first consultative umbrella organization representing environmental civil society organizations under the auspics of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism.\" [1]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn 2009, Mukhbayar and his allies convince the Parliament to draft a piece of legislation \"Law to prohibit mineral exploration and mining operations at headwaters of rivers, protected zones of water reservoirs and forested areas\", known as LLN or \"law with a long name\". The law was adopted but not implemented at first due to governement inefficiency and a huge opposition of international western mining compagnies, but also governments (Canada, US). [6]_x000D_\nThe legislation aim was to \"suspend mining in those identified areas\" and oblige mining companies \"to rehabilitate the mining sites in those areas within 2 years under the monitoring of the local governement and citizens\". Nearly 2000 such areas were initially listed and 248 placer gold mining licenses were suspended in the first phase. The law did encounter difficulties in determining the cost for the environmental damage caused by mining operations in those areas and the compensation for license holders (...) However, the enforcement of the law was sluggish and partial\". [1]_x000D_\nFor more information about the \"Law with a long name\", please refer to the \"Anti-mining protests and controversies around the \u201cLaw with the Long Name\u201d, Mongolia\" case in EJ Atlas. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn 2015, to avoid donor funding, a practice that co-opted the movement before (with international donors KAS and TAF, which led to a separation of the movement), Munkhbayar suggested that they plant berries (sea buckthorn) along the course of the Ongi River, something he learned from his mother. (...) It has multifunctional advantages both for the movement and for local people to succeed. First, they intended that this would maintain the water level of the river. Second, according to the legislation permits, any land with cultivated trees and bushes can be privatised by those who cultivate it; local herders can own land along the river, which prevents the loss of local pasture around the river to mining companies. Third, they can profit from the berries by selling them, and the movement can be self-funded in the future by using the income\". \"He also founded a herd for the movement (...) The easiest and quickest way to make it happen was by collecting donations from local herders\". It was a success and permit to help self-funding the movement.

The struggles of the River Movements contributed to this decline.

Several doctors are active in this EJO. They support the Meccano-trac\u00e9 from stRaten-generaal.\nRingland is a new player since 2014 and not an EJO but a group of architects and urban planners - supported by campaigners. Since they launched their plan to put a roof on the ring road, they gained over 10.000 supporters in just 2 months. Ademloos and stRaten-general support Ringland and Ringland supports them. However, the Ringland plan doesn't deal with a 3th crossing of de Schelde river by a highway - it deals with the problem of pollution at the existing highway.

Opinion polls show a big progress for both the green and the radical left party in Antwerp, together winning 25% of the vote (from 15% together in last elections) - at least in part because these parties support the action groups and have always been against the plans from BAM. This has some repercussions on the regional elections slated for May 25.\nUPDATE 31.05.16\nAfter 20 years of struggle, the three action groups in Belgium's second city who resist the Ring Road highway extension to a 27 lane monster scored a major breakthrough.

In 2016, the European Commission will publish a list of clean and safe ship recycling yards, which responsible ship owners can use.\nThe NGO Shipbreaking Platform and the Sustainable Development Policy Institute recommend the following actions to the Federal and Provincial Governments, the shipbreaking industry as well as the relevant international organisations:\n- The Federal Government together with the relevant provincial authorities should develop and implement a \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb, that is a cross-departmental policy to formalise the sector and to allow for the much needed change towards clean and safe ship recycling off the beach and compliant with international and domestic law, based on guidance offered by the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO.\n- The Federal Government and the provincial authorities should seek advice from the international institutions, in particular the Basel Convention Secretariat, the ILO and the IMO, and build partnerships to finance the needed investments in infrastructure. As the investment needed for compliance with international standards, especially with regards to waste management, is beyond the financial capacity of the shipbreaking industry in Pakistan, development banks or the Global Environment Facility (GEF), for example, could assist Pakistan in altering its shipbreaking practices to become safe and clean.\n- The \u00abGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u00bb should provide a roadmap for investments in the technical infrastructure of the shipbreaking yards to allow for the transition towards safer methods off the beach (e.g. impermeable floors and drainage system, heavy lifting equipment, electricity and water supply).\n- The Government of Pakistan should cooperate with the other shipbreaking countries in South Asia \u2013 India and Bangladesh \u2013 in a joint effort to exchange experience and alter shipbreaking practices so that competitiveness is not based on the lowest standards, but that instead a \u2018level playing field\u2019 is negotiated between shipbreaking countries.\n- Taking into account already existing legal provisions, the Federal Government together with the Provincial Government need to develop a sector-specific \u00abRegulation for Green Ship Recycling in Pakistan\u00bb. The new Regulation needs to accommodate the overlaps in responsibilities between the national and provincial level with regards to legal requirements and the institutional framework after the 18th amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (the decentralisation) and needs to clearly define the competent authorities\u2019 roles.\n- The new regulation should be based on a comprehensive review of existing legislation and a gap analysis, and should allow for the implementation of international obligations under the Basel Convention as well as the future Hong Kong Convention.\n- The new regulation needs to set out the authorisation criteria for facilities, to establish a set of rules for facility operation, including the procedures to obtain permits for different kinds of hazardous work, clearly define which authority needs to issue certificates and approvals, and set up an effective facility inspection regime to ensure that shipbreaking only occurs in accordance with the regulation\u2019s requirements.\n- With regards to hazardous waste management, the \u201cGreen Ship Recycling Strategy\u201d needs to include a plan to establish: a reception facility for operationally and non-operationally generated waste at a port close to the yards with a mandatory port call for all imported end-of-life vessels to perform cleaning activities such as cleaning cargo tanks, emptying bilge tanks, paint and chemical stores, and unloading waste oil and surplus fuel, waste storage on the yards,  waste reception facilities such as a sanitary landfill,  disposal treatment facility for hazardous waste such as PCBs, a system to track hazardous waste and to avoid the repartition into the market, establishment of a testing laboratory with portable equipment, regular monitoring of the presence of contaminants in soil, water, sediments and air.\n- There is an immediate need for training, awareness-raising and capacity building for workers to ensure safe operations. The government should provide a training centre and seek the assistance of the Basel Convention Secretariat and ILO for further guidance on materials and the organisation of the training45.\n- With regards to workers\u2019 rights, health and safety and living conditions, and irrespective of trade union membership, the authorities need to accommodate for: the immediate implementation of the applicable laws relative to labour rights, notably the Factories Act 1934, the Industrial and Commercial Employment Ordinance 1968, the Industrial Relations Ordinance 2002, as well as relevant provisions of the Pakistan Constitution and the Pakistan Penal Code, the immediate improvement of workers\u2019 living conditions including supply of drinking water and proper sanitation, the introduction of occupational health and safety procedures, the enforcement of the use of adequate PPE, a health care system for the workers including rapid access to a hospital, the availability of a medical insurance for workers, an adequate system for emergency response, the documentation of casualties, injuries, damages and occupational diseases and effective record-keeping, the provision of contracts or letter of appointments for workers and their automatic registration for social benefits.\n- With regards to the dangers of asbestos, the sector-specific regulation needs to include strict requirements regarding OHS standards during removal, storage and disposal of asbestos to make sure that workers are not harmed and that elements containing asbestos cannot be re-sold. There is a need for regular medical check-ups. It is advisable to introduce a federal bill on asbestos safety.\n- The responsible authorities need to monitor the implementation of laws and have enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes a training programme tailored for the designated officials including the judiciary. Compliance needs to be monitored especially with regards to: workers\u2019 registration for social benefits, provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), application of environmental, health and safety procedures, use of obligatory on-site pollution control and safety gadgets, periodic monitoring of maintenance and improvements of on-site equipment, provision of sufficient, improved and satisfactory on-site health care system, adequate training status of workers and awareness of hazards, maintenance of hazardous waste inventory and disposal.\n- The Government of Pakistan should ratify the Basel Ban Amendment and Hong Kong Convention and seek early com- pliance with the provisions under the latter. Moreover, the Government should ratify ILO Convention No. 187 and enforce all the provisions of the Basel Convention.\n- The Government lease agreements with the economic operators should be conditional and binding to ensure that the operators comply with all provisions. The current lease amount is very low compared to the profit margins and should be adjusted accordingly. Both the revenue from leases and taxes should be invested in upgrading the facilities and the surrounding infrastructure.\n- The State Bank of Pakistan should issue a directive to commercial banks for compliance with social and environmental safeguard policies and legislation with regards to loans given to the shipbreaking sector.\n- The Federal Government should support a study to define the level and distribution of contamination in and around the shipbreaking yards, and develop an inventory of hazardous wastes (e.g. for the unmarked asbestos dumping grounds). It should identify \u201chot spots\u201d that need to be cleaned up. It can seek the international organisations\u2019 expertise and support for this task. The SBC (UNEP) has started a survey in that sense and the Federal Government should make sure they cooperate and access the information gathered.\n- Both the Federal and Provincial Government need to promote unbiased research on the working conditions and the environmental impact of shipbreaking. They need to allow for transparency and enhance civil society involvement. Moreover, they should embrace the active participation of trade unions and promote their inde- pendent and democratic structures.","other_outcomes":null,"success_reason":"Within the Pakistani scenario, the ship breaking industry remains a hazardous industry for both workers and the environment.

If the EJO and the town parliament represented the popular opinion, the vote against the geothermal drilling was a success in terms of respect towards the local democratic will. Numerous similar initiatives against deep geothermal drillings in other parts of Germany, especially the south, relate to Meiningen as an inspiring success. \nHowever another point of view is that each region should contribute to the energy transition (energiewende), counting geothermal energy as part of renewable energy technologies. That is often the main argument in favour of deep Geothermal energy, that it is for the common good, the energy transition. Such a position is supported by all environmental NGO. Only one report from the German NGO BUND raised critical concerns on geothermal power (Strom und W\u00e4rmeerzeugung aus Geothermie, BUND 2007).\nSome anti-geothermal initiatives question in how far geothermal is renewable. Briefly, their argument is that the detriments like water pollution and earthquakes are not proportional to the amount of energy generated. (Often the equivalent of one or a few big wind turbines) The second argument is, that deep GT sites can buy very cheap electricity at industry tariffs (11 c per KwH) and \"transform\" it into renewable electricity to be sold for 25 c per KwH. The rationale is, that in contrast to PV or wind, a certain part of electricity has to be invested for the pumping process, before Geothermal generates electricity.\nThe debate on the status of GT is still ongoing. A majority of international and national environmental NGO is in favour of deep GT. A minority doubts the merits of GT. \nDepending on the point of view one takes, Meiningen is a success for a local environmental justice struggle against a risk technology, or a failure for the general energy transition.
