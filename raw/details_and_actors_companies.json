In 1956, the mine began to use low-grade ore to refine arsenic and use smelting furnace tail gas to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and Calcium Sulphate (CaS2O8). In 1968, the realgar mine was devolved to Changde City. In 1978, the state stopped the refining behaviour of the realgar mine, built a sulfuric acid plant and a phosphate fertilizer plant. In 1998, it was reorganized into Hunan Realgar Chemical Co., Ltd. In May 2001, the company went bankrupt and restructured and carried out employee and asset replacement. In August 2003, the government of Changde City agreed to reorganize Shimen Realgar Chemical Co., Ltd., Shimen Realgar Mining Co., Ltd., Shimen Realgar Mine Cement Co., Ltd., Shimen Realgar Mine Machinery Factory and Shimen Realgar Mine Hospital. In 2009, the Shimen County government closed Cement plant.

Maeda Corporation was established in 1946._x000D_\n\u3000Later, Maeda used electric blasting for safe construction of the Tagokura Dam (completed in 1960). The Arimine Dam (completed in 1961) was successfully constructed despite extremely adverse environmental conditions. For construction of the Takase Dam (completed in 1979), a computer network linking the company's head office with the construction site was quickly created to support of operation of heavy machinery and quality control, and stones were piled on the dam slope to create a structure in harmony with local scenery. In this way, Maeda established its status as one of Japan's leading dam builders. The Technical Research Laboratory was established in 1976._x000D_\nMaeda also actively developed its overseas business, receiving orders for a landfill project in Hong Kong in 1963 and construction of the Asian Highway in Thailand in 1965._x000D_\nMaeda acquired ISO 14001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2001, began to hold a Zero Emissions Liaison Conference in 2002, and completed registration for acquisition of ISO 9001 certification in Japan as a single entity in 2003. In addition, in 2006, Maeda issued the first CSR report in the Japanese construction industry and was ranked first in the industry in the Third Quality Management Level Research in 2007. The company also completed construction of The Tokyo Towers, a high-rise, twin-tower condominium complex (completed in 2008)._x000D_\n\u3000Overseas developments include subway construction in Hong Kong and Taiwan that is currently underway and plant construction for Japanese companies in Thailand.

Comprised of over one hundred subsidiaries and research institutions, CNNC controls most nuclear sector business, including research and development, design, uranium exploration and mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal.[2]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn 16 September 1988 China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China\u2019s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry\u2019s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d on nuclear power development in China.[7]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China\u2019s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations \u201cof squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects.\" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC\u2019s current president.[8]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed

safety.[10]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nCNNC\u2019s current list of subsidies and member institutions is as follows:[11]_x000D_\n_x000D_\n    China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (CNEIC)_x000D_\n    China

Comprised of over one hundred subsidiaries and research institutions, CNNC controls most nuclear sector business, including research and development, design, uranium exploration and mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal.[2]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn 16 September 1988 China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress announced that the Ministry of Nuclear Industry (MNI) (formally the Second Ministry of Machine Building) would be reorganized into the CNNC.[3] This corporatization was part of a China\u2019s larger restructuring of defense industries, with the intention of reducing the nuclear industry\u2019s reliance on the government for financial support.[4] Chinese leaders encouraged the nuclear industry to export its products as a means of earning hard currency for the purchase of Western technology, and by 1990 CNNC had established trading relations with over 100 companies in over 40 countries.[5] By the mid-1990s, CNNC had grown to a corporation with 300,000 employees, and it managed over 200 enterprises and institutions.[6] At this point, CNNC had a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d on nuclear power development in China.[7]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn the 2000s CNNC began to face calls for reform and competition, most notably from State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC), which China\u2019s State Council established in 2004. While SNPTC administered bidding by foreign companies for Generation III reactors for future nuclear development, CNNC under President Kang Rixin resisted such change and supported the development of the CNP-1000, a pressurized water reactor developed largely by the Shanghai Nuclear Energy Research & Design Institute (SNERDI). In 2009, President Kang was fired amid accusations \u201cof squandering public funds and interfering with the bidding results of nuclear power projects.\" He was replaced by Sun Qin, CNNC\u2019s current president.[8]_x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn June 2012, French firm Areva agreed to supply natural uranium to CNNC from 2012 to 2025.[9] The same month, the Chinese State Council Executive Meeting passed
