Some of the most notable risks that the chemicals at the Superfund site pose for humans include, skin irritation, skin photosensitization, gastrointestinal irritation, dermatitis, eye irritation, obstructive lung alterations, emphysema, lung cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancer, anemia, respiration difficulties, chest pain, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, psychotic tendencies, proteinuria, dermatitis, dizziness, nerve damage, hearing loss, color vision loss, learning deficits, altered motor skill, immune system damage, and reproductive impairment for individuals of all genders [14, 15]._x000D_\n    Some of the toxins at the site present health impacts specific to children\u2019s growth and bodies. Most notably the presence of lead has negative implications for children\u2019s developing nervous systems and is definitively linked to hyperactivity, attention problems, and cognitive impairment [14]._x000D_\n    Additionally, some of the chemicals present are regulated by government agencies and national legislation. Constraints for arsenic contamination levels, for example, have been set by the FDA, the Clean Water Act, Federal Drinking Water standards, RCRA requirements and CERCLA Superfund Requirements [14].","other_socio_economical_impacts":"The proximity of the Homestead Air Reserve Base Superfund Site to the Homestead Shelter for Unaccompanied Children creates a host of socio-economic impacts. By nature, the population at the shelter is marginalized in U.S. society. Specifically, at risk is a population comprised of child migrants. These individuals are disenfranchised in the United States because of their identities as children, as migrants without citizenship and\/or asylum seekers, as people of color, as detained (incarcerated) individuals, and as non-native English speakers. Any one of these identities alone disenfranchises a population and has the potential to suppress their voice. Together these identities within the context of the United States form an incredibly oppressive mechanism, and effectively bar the individuals affected from having any agency in their situation of exposure to hazards at the Superfund site._x000D_\n    Many laws and international agreements protect these various vulnerable populations. Particularly notable in relation to the Homestead environmental justice site is the 1989 United Nations International Rights of the Child Convention, which has been signed (but not ratified) by the United States of America. The central guiding principles of the convention are set forth in article 6:1, \u201cStates Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,\u201d and in article 6:2 \u201cStates Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child\u201d [13]. The convention also clearly states that countries may not discriminate the allocation of the rights of children based on \u201cthe child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status\u201d [13 article 2:1]. The Homestead Shelter for Unaccompanied Children\u2019s operation is not in accordance with these policies, neglecting children\u2019s rights to healthy development and housing migrant children of color on land where schools and daycares for American children are prohibited [5].","other_environmental_impacts":"One key environmental impact unique to Homestead and other Florida Superfund sites by virtue of their location, is an enhanced risk of hurricanes spreading contamination [4]. Florida has the 6th most Superfund sites of all U.S. States, ranking behind only New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan respectively.  Of Florida\u2019s 53 Superfund sites, the Homestead Air Reserve Base is the lowest in elevation, with flooding potential occurring after only 12 inches of water accumulation [16]. Between rainfall, storm surges, tides, and flooding, 12 inches of water on site is a likely occurrence during hurricane season, making the potential for contamination to spread beyond current confines high [16]. Risks associated with hurricanes spreading the Superfund site contamination include the contamination of the Biscayne Aquifer, which sits underground less than three miles from the hazardous substances at the site [3]. More than 16,000 people get their drinking water from this aquifer, including the children at the Homestead Shelter for Unaccompanied Migrants.","slug":"homestead-temporary-shelter-for-unaccompanied-children"}

{"other_health_impacts":"The health impacts of long-term low level lead exposure in young children are lifelong, irreversible, and untreatable. Studies conducted over the last decades have shown harmful efects of lead at lower and lower blood lead levels, and no safe blood lead level in children has been identifed (Bellinger, 2008). As a result, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other authorities have concluded that there is no known acceptable blood lead exposure level for children (CDC, 2013). Evidence of reduced intelligence caused by childhood exposure to lead has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to list \u201clead caused mental retardation\u201d as a recognized disease.\nWHO also lists it as one of the top ten diseases whose health burden among children is due to modifable environmental factors (Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn and Corval\u00e1n, 2006).\nOnce lead enters a child\u2019s body through ingestion or inhalation or across the placenta, it has the potential to damage a number of biological systems and pathways. The primary target is the central nervous system and the brain, but it can also afect the blood system, the kidneys and the skeleton.\nChildren are more sensitive to the harmful efects of lead than adults for several reasons, including:\n\u2022 A child\u2019s brain undergoes very rapid growth, development and diferentiation and lead interferes with this process. For example, it has been shown that moderate blood lead exposure (5 to 40 \u03bcg\/dL) during early childhood is connected to regionspecifc reductions in adult gray matter volume (Cecil, et al., 2008).\n\u2022 Exposure to lead early in life can re-program genes, which can lead to altered gene expression and an associated increased risk of disease later in life (WHO, 2010; Mazumdar, et al., 2012).\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal absorption of lead is enhanced in childhood. Up to 50 percent of ingested lead is absorbed by children, as compared with 10 percent in adults. Pregnant women may also absorb more ingested lead than other adults. In addition, children are more likely to have nutritional defciencies that lead to increased absorption of lead (WHO, 2010). \nMorove exposure to lead can cause: Anaemia, Appetite loss, Weight loss, Behaviour and learning problems, such as hyperactivity, Slowed growth, Hearing problems, Headache, Lethargy, abdominal pains, paleness and vomiting,Degeneration of tissues in the central nervous system is more serious,Circulatory system, reproductive system and gastro-intestinal systems are damaged seriously [1]","other_socio_economical_impacts":null,"other_environmental_impacts":null,"slug":"lead-in-enamel-paint-in-sri-lanka"}

{"other_health_impacts":"Royal Commission into the nuclear tests finally took place in 1987, held in both the UK and Australia. The commission concluded that there had been faults, secrecy, lack of safety and pollution of the land in the tests.  However they stated that there was no firm evidence of health effects directly related to irradiation.  Evidence tendered at the time by Indigenous people was harrowing. For example, we were told of how Australian servicemen in the area instructed an Indigenous nomadic family to remain on the road and not to go into the bush to hunt because of poison.  They had become so terrified of the \u201cpoison\u201d that they obeyed instructions implicitly and 4 of the family of 6 eventually died of starvation. It is worth keeping in mind that at the Royal Commission Aboriginal people were asked to prove their stories and tell their history within a non-Indigenous framework. People from Maralinga were asked to prove the instances of cancers, birth defects, and genetic defects passed down because of exposure to ionising radiation: they were asked to prove that in a Western court of law and of course they couldn\u2019t. They did not have medical records; they had no death records , and their traditional law does not permit them to speak the name of\na deceased person. \nThe extremely limited resources devoted to finding and warning people (one experienced native patrol officer, Walter MacDougall was responsible for covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometres by car) led to incidents of radiation exposure. For example, in 1957, the Milpuddie family was found camping next to a crater left by a Maralinga test detonation.","other_socio_economical_impacts":"Loss of capability to sustain livelihoods due to chronic illnesses - eg cancer - from the exposure.

Sin embargo, es claro que se ha producido una la merma de los ecosistemas, las condiciones sanitarias se han vulnerado y hay una mayor exposici\u00f3n a la contaminaci\u00f3n ambiental y s\u00f3nica.","other_socio_economical_impacts":"Varias consecuencias provenientes de esta construcci\u00f3n han sido resaltadas, tales como la obstrucci\u00f3n de los desag\u00fces provenientes del suroeste de Caracas y la p\u00e9rdida de calidad de vida de los vecinos al perder el follaje de los \u00e1rboles, que constitu\u00edan una barrera natural al ruido y la contaminaci\u00f3n de la autopista.\nEduardo Cudisevich, ingeniero agr\u00f3nomo y miembro del Grupo Ecol\u00f3gico San Pedro, advirti\u00f3 que el car\u00e1cter sedimentario y aluvional del talud del r\u00edo donde se levantaron las columnas que sostendr\u00e1n al viaducto, no es el id\u00f3neo para una obra de esta magnitud.\nInstituciones como la Academia Nacional de la Ingenier\u00eda y el H\u00e1bitat (ANIH) han destacado como uno de los principales peligros el desbordamiento del r\u00edo Valle y las consiguientes inundaciones, que estar\u00edan provocados por la construcci\u00f3n de pilas en serie dentro de su cauce y llaman a tomar medidas para evitar calamidades p\u00fablicas. En agosto de 2015 y en abril de 2016 se produjeron desbordamientos de este tipo, inundando la autopista Valle-Coche e incluso llegando al metro de Caracas. El a\u00f1o pasado se le exig\u00eda al ministro El Troudi responder ante la inundaci\u00f3n provocada. Se ha denunciado una intensificaci\u00f3n de las inundaciones producto del desborde del r\u00edo ante lluvias m\u00e1s o menos fuertes. En junio de 2016 se desplomaron 5 casas del barrio Los Chaguaramos y 25 familias siguen viviendo en riesgo. Organizaciones que reivindican una movilidad alternativa para la ciudad, han se\u00f1alado que se sigue afectando la posibilidad de construir una peatonalidad y movilidad diferente. Se denuncia que se le otorga prioridad al autom\u00f3vil y se genera una desarmon\u00eda de la relaci\u00f3n que tiene la gente con el espacio que se encuentra abajo del viaducto, sea la Universidad Central de Venezuela, la Universidad Bolivariana, Los Chaguaramos, entre otros. Se ha afectado el espacio p\u00fablico y se ha destruido una parte de la ciclov\u00eda que se hab\u00eda construido en la zona, creando una ciudad muy hostil para el peat\u00f3n y el ciclista.","other_environmental_impacts":"La instalaci\u00f3n de las estructuras del viaducto supuso retirar cientos de \u00e1rboles del lugar. Se denuncia que se enumeraron para su extracci\u00f3n m\u00e1s de 400 \u00e1rboles, caobos en su mayor\u00eda, distribuidos a lo largo de la cuenca del r\u00edo Valle. Seg\u00fan el Ministerio de Transporte y Obras P\u00fablicas, estos fueron trasplantados y llevados a otras zonas de Caracas (una cifra de menos de 200, seg\u00fan el ente ministerial). Grupos ambientalistas indicaron en cambio que la tala fue indiscriminada. Esto supuso que se eliminara buena parte de la vegetaci\u00f3n a lo largo del rio, teniendo impacto en la propia vegetaci\u00f3n y fauna de la zona, como las garzas que ven\u00edan del C\u00edrculo Militar y se desplazaban hacia el Parque del Este siguiendo su cauce. Tambi\u00e9n se perdi\u00f3 el paisaje natural que hab\u00eda tardado al menos 30 a\u00f1os en formarse, la regulaci\u00f3n de la temperatura urbana que ofrec\u00eda el ecosistema, la contenci\u00f3n del talud que proporcionaban las ra\u00edces de estos \u00e1rboles, adem\u00e1s que la zona ha quedado m\u00e1s expuesta a la contaminaci\u00f3n urbana. \u00c1reas aleda\u00f1as quedan m\u00e1s vulnerables como el parque Francisco Pimentel, \u00fanico espacio verde la parroquia San Pedro.\nOtro impacto se\u00f1alado es al r\u00edo Valle, dado que el viaducto se ha construido encima del mismo, lo cual al taparle el aire y la luz lo afectar\u00e1 dram\u00e1ticamente.

{"other_health_impacts":"The data on the health impacts observed come from the epidemiological survey of 2012, which showed that \"the deaths caused by Ilva in the period 2004 to 2010 were 174, 83 of these are attributable to the violation of the limits of environmental dust (PM10). For the neighbourhoods surrounding the city, since the situation is relatively more serious, the victims are 91 (...) \"with a reference to the workers who served in the Ilva plant in the period between the years 70-90m\n, there were detected excesses of mortality for cancer diseases. [16]. Still, the last Sentieri study 2014 has identified and ensures a clear increase in the incidence of cancer and infant mortality (respectively   54% and   21% compared to the average of Puglia), attributable to emissions and discharges of Ilva. The study also points out an obvious load of dioxins and PCBs in farm workers near the plant [17]. The studies of the Fondo Antidiossina have detected a high presence of dioxin in breast milk of the women of Taranto. In addition, over the years, several workplace accidents were registered in the plant, beyond 1696 occupational diseases reported to INAIL (National Institute for the Insurance against work related injury) between 1998 and 2010. The total indifference and disregard for the health protection of workers, detected and confirmed thanks to the testimonies of workers, caused the conviction in 2014 for manslaughter against 27 Ilva manager [18]","other_socio_economical_impacts":"The women of Taranto had a very important role. The mothers, in particular, have figured out even before the expert opinions of the close link between the high number of cancer in children and the pollution produced by the establishment. Physicians, paediatricians and the Italian Association against Leukemia supported their demand and fears; they ask for clean air, the right to health of their children and a register of endometriosis, a condition that affects a large number of women in Taranto [18]. At the same time, many of these women who fight on the front line have been forced to give up their right to health, refusing to sign the petitions in the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, because their husbands are employed at Ilva.","other_environmental_impacts":"In the technical report  by ARPA (Regional Agency for the environmental protection) in 2008, the data indicated a quantity of Ilva discharges equal to 145000 m3 \/ h for a daily capacity of 3.48 million m3, indicating that the 93% of the aliphatic hydrocarbons discharged into the Gulf of Taranto are attributable to the same establishment [ 13]. The chemical survey in 2012 also stated that two years before Ilva issued from its chimneys over 4000 tons of dust, 11 thousand tons of nitrogen dioxide and 11 thousand and 300 tons of sulfur dioxide and 7 tons of hydrochloric acid, 1.3 tons of benzene, 338.5 pounds IPA, 52.5 grams of benzo (a) pyrene, 14.9 grams of organic compounds dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated [14]. The order for seizure in 05\/22\/2013, however, used a report of ARPA Puglia of 12\/03\/2013, which demonstrated the excessive amounts of dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls, in addition to Tetrafurani, indicating the presence of slag within the plant [15]. Finally, in 2013, six stations were installed for the detection of pollutants, especially H2S, PM10, PM10 with SWAM 5a. By the way, unfortunately, due to the limits prescribed by Decree. 155\/10 these values are not applicable in the area of the plant as private.

{"other_health_impacts":"Chemicals needed for the mantain of the Golf course in good condition will accumulate in the tanks irrigated by the Weli Oya Irrigation Project. Contamination of these tanks causes serious health problems in the community that depends on these tanks for their water requirements. There is a threat of skin diseases and cancer due to the intensive use of pesticides and other agro-chemicals for the management of golf ground.","other_socio_economical_impacts":"The forests cleared are vital catchment areas for Weli Oya. Maintenance of a golf course requires a substantial amount of water which should be obtained either from Weli Oya or groundwater which are the only available sources in the area. Whichever source is utilized by the project, it will have negative impacts on the Weli Oya Irrigation Project and its beneficiaries. This leads to displacement of the farmers using water from the Irrigation Project for cultivation. Further, construction of the hotel and golf course will result in a severe scarcity of potable water in the Dry Zone leading to serious socioeconomic problems","other_environmental_impacts":"1. There are over 7,000 trees that have been marked to be cut down\n2. The land marked for the hotel project blocks the elephant corridor between the Uda Walawa National Park and Bogahapittiya sanctuary. If the project proceeds, the elephants would be forced to enter villages resulting in a massive human-elephant conflict. \n3. It is prime forest territory, with savannah grasslands inhabited by elephant, bear, sambhur, and other animals. Precious tropical deciduous forestland in Bogahapattiya is threatened by developers. If the golf course project go through, Sri Lanka will lose considerable area of an extremely biodiverse forest. \n4. Loss of vegetation caused by deforestation leads to soil erosion and run-off. The silted water ends up in the Weli Oya reservoir, which irrigates more than 3,000 acres of paddy land and feeds 27 small tanks.\n5. The forest  feeds two streams that enter the Weli Oya, which in turn feeds into the Walawe. After implementing the project these streams will dry off, creating a huge water problem in the area. The entire area is a hugely important watershed for populations downstream. The land selected for the golf course comes right up to where the two streams, including the Demata Ara, join up with the Weli Oya at a small dam. Construction work on the intended golf course will disrupt the Weli Oya irrigation system. Thousands of families depend on agriculture based on the waters of the Weli Oya.\n6. In order to maintain the golf course in good condition, water and the fertilizer urea as well as pesticides should be used in large quantities. Aluminum compounds should be applied to the field in order to enhance binding of soil particles and prevent soil erosion. These chemicals will finally accumulate in the tanks irrigated by the Weli Oya Irrigation Project. That will be harmful to existing faunal and floral diversity.\n7. An extensive study has been carried out on the vertebrate diversity of the Bogahapattiya-Soragune-Samanala Wewa Forest Area by Mr. L.J. Mendis Wickramasinghe of the Herpetological Foundation of Sri Lanka. The unpublished report, \u2018A Vertebrate Faunal Survey of Samanala Wewa, Towards Declaration as a Wildlife National Park\u2019 identifies around 390 species from 5 vertebrate families. Out of that, 59 are endemic to Sri Lanka. Around 40% of the total number of vertebrate species and 19% of the endemic vertebrate species in the country are found in the area, according to the report. A number of extremely rare species and also several new species have been recorded from the forest.","slug":"eco-golf-resort-project-in-soragune-forest"}

Anthropic activities have had in the years strong environmental impacts on the lagoon, on the amount of water entering the lagoon and thus on possible floods.These activities have included the reduction of the flow of the lagoon basin (a few parts buried to create fields and industrial zones) and the deepen of the major entrance channels to allow the entry to the bigger ships. The further deepening of the channels, as required by the MOSE, and the consequent more intense water exchange with the sea, would cause a significantly increased erosion of the lagoon bed. The project caused measurable damages to the lagoon environment during the lengthy building phase \u2013 like the dunes in Ca\u2019Roman and Alberoni and the Secca del Bacan [3].\nThe designed system would react to events (high tides in excess of 110 cm) whose frequency is unknown. If the 110 cm limit will be trespassed frequently (from 100 to 250 times a year according with previsions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report 2007) the lagoon would become a closed basin and the pollution would became deadly (all town sewers flow into the lagoon, and depuration is done through the tidal water exchange).","slug":"mose-project-in-venetian-lagoon"}

Voceros de la comunidad se\u00f1alan que la salina est\u00e1 siendo gestionada con negligencia y que esto se encuentra vinculado a la intenci\u00f3n de imponer el proyecto del puerto. Todos estos factores unidos tendr\u00e1n un notable impacto social en la regi\u00f3n, creando un n\u00famero importante de poblaci\u00f3n laboralmente desocupada, presionando a la migraci\u00f3n de centenares de trabajadores hacia el puerto de aguas profundas y provocando en general dependencia social a esta infraestructura. \nC\u00e1lculos de la comunidad indican que la migraci\u00f3n podr\u00eda superar las 25.000 personas lo cual generar\u00e1 un muy gran impacto demogr\u00e1fico en la regi\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n se se\u00f1ala un incremento del costo de la vida y un impacto a las viviendas de los habitantes debido a las nuevas construcciones, como ya ha ocurrido con pescadores quienes les han derrumbado sus rancher\u00edas y la empresa que construye el astillero se niega a indemnizarlos.","other_environmental_impacts":" Los ecosistemas de la zona son fr\u00e1giles y representan un espacio de biodiversidad marina sumamente importante para el pa\u00eds, dado que es un centro de desove de la mayor\u00eda de las especies marinas que circulan en el mar Caribe, especialmente de la sardina. Los impactos aumentan cuando la intervenci\u00f3n ambiental se produce en sistemas semi-cerrados como lo es el Golfo de Cariaco, e incluyen la depredaci\u00f3n de los recursos acu\u00e1ticos vivos y el desgaste de la cantidad y calidad alimentaria de las aguas. En la fase de construcci\u00f3n del puerto, actividades como los dragados pueden causar alteraciones definitivas y traum\u00e1ticas de los fondos marinos. Inaugurada la instalaci\u00f3n, se producir\u00eda la invasi\u00f3n de especies ex\u00f3genas, como resultado del vertido de aguas de lastre; acumulaci\u00f3n de desechos de buques, muchas veces con sustancias desconocidas; alteraciones continuas en los niveles de calidad de agua, aire y suelos; y una urbanizaci\u00f3n acelerada.  Se ha denunciado tambi\u00e9n que la rehabilitaci\u00f3n camaronera podr\u00eda traer de vuelta las consecuencias pasadas, dado que esta industria vert\u00eda sus desechos qu\u00edmicos al golfo alejando la pesca por a\u00f1os. Otro de los impactos se\u00f1alados es la deforestaci\u00f3n y destrucci\u00f3n de las plantas aut\u00f3ctonas, y la amenaza de desaparici\u00f3n de especies. Se reforzar\u00eda la desertizaci\u00f3n, influyendo al mismo tiempo en el per\u00edodo de lluvias; y se producir\u00eda una alteraci\u00f3n de los paisajes, con ruido, polvo, contaminaci\u00f3n del aire y tr\u00e1fico.

{"other_health_impacts":"Coal ash contains natural metals that can become toxic to humans upon exposure (i.e., arsenic, lead, and radioactive metals) [7]. These metals are especially dangerous when they contaminate groundwater or break down into particles that come into contact with skin and\/or are ingested [7]. Ultra-fine coal ash particles are associated with air pollutants, such as smog and exhaust, and are part of the ambient air pollutants that cause approximately 4.2 millions deaths worldwide each year [7][9]. The coal ash from the Kingston Fossil Plant contains over 20 known toxins [7]. Because cleanup workers were misinformed about the toxicity of the coal ash, workers often inhaled, ate near (consumed), and came into direct skin contact with coal ash [7] Additionally, cleanup workers brought ash dust into their homes due to the lack of decontamination facilities [10]_x000D_\n _x000D_\nWater bodies contaminated by the coal ash spill were frequently used as drinking water sources [13]. Contaminants found in the rivers, specifically lead and thallium, have historically caused birth defects and reproductive issues [13]. A few months after the spill, a TVA spokesperson shared that even though the aforementioned contaminants exceeded the limits of safe drinking water in the river, they would be filtered out, allowing for the water to be safely consumed again [13]. Despite reassurance, many residents still felt uncomfortable drinking the water due to the severity of the coal ash spill [13]. In 2018, USATNT published evidence of groundwater test well pollution at the Kingston Plant\u2019s coal ash landfill [2]. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nCleanup workers continuously reported health issues following the spill [7]. This included, but was not limited to, skin, cardiovascular, circulatory system, and pulmonary issues [7]. Ansol Clark, one of the first cleanup workers to arrive at the site, developed chronic heart issues and blood cancer after working at the spill site [7]. It is believed that Clark\u2019s issues may have been caused by coal ash radiation [7]. Frankie Norris reported skin sores (which was common amongst cleanup workers) and colon failure [7]. Tommy Johnson, also amongst the first workers to arrive at the site, reported that he suffers from chronic lung function issues [7]. Because cleanup workers inadvertently brought coal ash dust into their homes, this affected the health of the cleanup worker\u2019s family members, many of whom also developed cancers and breathing issues following the spill [10]. These are but a few of the side effects that hundreds of cleanup workers and family members have experienced. By July of 2022, over 50 cleanup workers had died of health-related issues since the spill [14] Currently, more than 200 cleanup workers and their family members are sick or suffer from chronic health issues as a result of the coal ash [24]. ","other_socio_economical_impacts":"Eight years after the coal ash spill in 2018, the Roane County population had declined by over 1,500 residents [14]. The population began increasing in 2009, but as of 2021, the county\u2019s population has yet to exceed the 54,374 residents that resided in Roane County in 2008 [14]. It is likely that in the years following the coal ash spill, residents who could afford to leave the county did while fewer people moved into the county. In 2019, Roane County and the cities of Kingston and Harriman sued both Jacobs Engineering and the TVA for damages suffered by the community as a whole [22]. These claims were dismissed in 2020 by the same federal district court judge presiding over the property owners\u2019 and cleanup workers\u2019 suits as barred by the statute of limitations and for being insufficiently pleaded [22]. ","other_environmental_impacts":"Interest in the Kingston Fossil Plant spill has been primarily focused on the human health and property damage impacts of the coal ash. However, the environmental impacts of spilling 300 acres of toxic ash should not be overlooked. Toxins contaminated the area\u2019s natural resources, including water bodies (Emory and Clinch Rivers) that lead into the Tennessee River [11]. For four years, the Emory River was dredged in an attempt to remove contaminants [15]. Near the end of the project, cleanup workers were ordered to stop dredging because of the shockingly high level of contaminants found in the river [15]. TVA then opted to have the Emory River \u201crecover naturally\u201d from the remaining contaminants, with environmental monitoring for the following 30 years [15] [32]._x000D_\n_x000D_\nScientists found that downstream river water had lead levels 400 times greater than the EPA recommends, and even greater levels of lead within the river\u2019s surface water [12][13]. Beryllium was found at levels 160 times greater than the EPA\u2019s safe limit [13]. High levels of arsenic were found, indicating low-oxygen conditions in the water [12]. River water tests also revealed higher levels of lead and thallium after the spill [13]. These contaminants may continue to spread into other critical environmental resources, causing even greater harm upon humans and wildlife [12]. ","slug":"kingston-fossil-plant-harriman-tn"}

The optimum pH level of majority of the aquatic animals lies between pH 6.5 to 9. Any further change in the optimum pH causes strain on animal physiology, reduces hatching and survival rate. Aquatic animals are more sensitive towards acids than alkalis. A change in pH with 0.5 towards acid from pure water (pH 7) causes aquatic animals in an abnormal environment and cannot survive when the pH level is lower than 3. Highly concentrated acids in the local river due to leakage of water leaching site may have altered the level of pH to as low as 3 causing death of fish and damage to the entire local river ecosystem. The water leaching site might contain organic wastes (dead plants and animals) since the mining site was closed for a few years, the organic wastes drained into river water are decomposed by aerobic bacteria. Decomposition of the organic wastes is a major function of aerobic bacteria to provide nutrient to aquatic animals and requires oxygen which in turn cause depletion in oxygen level to other aquatic animals. High concentration of nitrates and phosphate if present in the contaminated water can be a factor lowering dissolved oxygen and causing high mortality rate of fish.

La importante degradaci\u00f3n acu\u00e1tica en el Delta ha producido en \u00e9stos varias enfermedades, lo cual ha venido creciendo en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Diarreas es uno de los efectos m\u00e1s comunes, afectando severamente a ni\u00f1os y pudiendo causarles la muerte. Se cuenta tambi\u00e9n altos niveles de diabetes, glicemia en poblaci\u00f3n infantil y tuberculosis. Seg\u00fan una investigaci\u00f3n de la Fundaci\u00f3n La Salle del a\u00f1o 2001, el 95% de la poblaci\u00f3n warao padece desnutrici\u00f3n y parasitosis. \nEl cacique de la comunidad ind\u00edgena de Bonoina ha denunciado un aumento de la muerte de waraos por \u201cextra\u00f1as enfermedades\u201d. Esto se ha vinculado con la contaminaci\u00f3n de las aguas y los peces por mercurio y otros componentes t\u00f3xicos. Tambi\u00e9n, diversos estudios han mostrado una dram\u00e1tica realidad: un muy acelerado aumento de infecciones de VIH en la poblaci\u00f3n warao, los cuales han estado muriendo con rapidez. Seg\u00fan los especialistas que realizaron la investigaci\u00f3n, 9,55% de los habitantes de ocho comunidades estudiadas hab\u00edan contra\u00eddo el virus. La m\u00e1s alta prevalencia en el mundo est\u00e1 en el \u00c1frica subsahariana, con 5% de su poblaci\u00f3n. En 2015, la periodista Minerva Vitti indicaba que hay presencia del virus VIH en 26 comunidades. Alejandro Lanz, del Centro de Investigaciones Ecol\u00f3gicas de Venezuela, presume que el origen de estos contagios sea el flujo migratorio de waraos que ha existido hacia el vertedero de Cambalache en Ciudad Guayana, donde los ind\u00edgenas realizan recolecci\u00f3n de basura en condiciones sanitarias y sociales muy comprometidas.","other_socio_economical_impacts":"La situaci\u00f3n de contaminaci\u00f3n ha mermado notablemente sus medios de vida, fundamentalmente sus aguas y peces.

Existe dependencia de potabilizadoras de agua, y cuando existe ausencia de las mismas, los ind\u00edgenas se ven obligados a beber el agua contaminada.\nLa migraci\u00f3n warao a las ciudades ha crecido notablemente en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, lo que ha supuesto que estos ind\u00edgenas se incorporen a la mendicidad, en condiciones deplorables de vida, con altos niveles de discriminaci\u00f3n y ubicados en los barrios perif\u00e9ricos de estos centros urbanos.","other_environmental_impacts":"Permanentemente las aguas del Orinoco, y por ende el Delta, han sido contaminadas por los desechos industriales provenientes de las empresas b\u00e1sicas de Guayana, ubicadas en Ciudad Guayana.

{"other_health_impacts":"It is quite common for coal ash from dumps to impact the environment and, as a result, the health of those who inhabit the area [5]. Despite Arrowhead Landfill\u2019s assertions that it has protected Uniontown groundwater from the coal ash, residents noticed an unusual odor and taste coming from the water soon after the coal ash arrived at the site. This made many residents afraid to drink their tap water, something they had formerly been able to enjoy without fear of contamination [2]. Despite such concerns, the EPA, ADEM, and the City of Uniontown have not tested the water [1]. Residents who could afford to do so began buying bottled water and using it for drinking and cooking. Due to the economic situation in Uniontown, where the average income is below $10,000, many residents cannot afford this additional expense. If the groundwater is contaminated, it is likely that those who could not afford alternative water sources have suffered negative health impacts from exposure to the chemicals. More so, the young, old, and medically vulnerable are most likely to suffer severe consequences. On the other hand, residents with asthma had their condition triggered by the airborne ash particles, causing health complications within their respiratory systems and breathing issues [1,2]. Others have complained that the ash emits an unpleasant odor and interferes with their ability to sleep. Additionally, as expected based on the short-term effects of coal ash exposure, Uniontown residents have reported frequent dizziness, nausea, and irritation to their eyes, nose, and throat since the arrival of the coal ash. Unsurprisingly, some citizens have found it difficult to breathe and experience frequent sore throats because of the ash particles [1]. Cancer and other serious illnesses have also become more common in the community after the coal ash arrived, leading people to believe that the coal ash was the cause [6]. ","other_socio_economical_impacts":"In late 2015, Arrowhead Landfill degraded part of New Hope Church Cemetery so severely that several gravestones could not be located or identified. This was understandably extremely upsetting and stressful for relatives of the deceased and residents who value the presence of the historic cemetery within their community [9]. Adding to that distress is the fear that the cemetery also receives discharge from the landfill, as people who reside nearby have reported seeing it in their own backyards. One man shared with Earthjustice that several of his dogs had died after being exposed to this toxic liquid. Another impact from the airborne coal ash is that many Uniontown houses were stained and numerous citizens reported the paint on their cars coming off. Such impacts severely decrease real estate and property values, making it extremely difficult for people to sell their homes or cars. If people do manage to sell their homes or cars, they won\u2019t receive the same amount of money for them that they would have before the coal ash negatively impacted the value of that property [2]. It is also likely that property values in the area have decreased because of the increase in pollution from the coal ash [1]. ","other_environmental_impacts":"While the primary concerns about the coal ash stem from health impacts that Uniontown residents face, there are also environmental concerns. Almost immediately after the coal ash was moved into Arrowhead Landfill, Uniontown residents noticed changes within their community. The ash from the landfill was not properly contained and quickly became airborne. This created large coal ash-dust storms that residents had to drive and walk through daily [2].

{"other_health_impacts":"Possible impact of  dioxins, furans, chloride, mercury and other\u202ftoxic heavy metals. Residents of the local area are concerned about the cumulative impact of exposure to air pollution from the mill, contamination of soil and water supply from effluent treatment and the pipeline leaks. The Pictou region has the seventh highest rate of cancer in the country, of 106 health regions. Air quality in the region is poor, can irritate people with health sensitivities, and produces an odor. In addition to ongoing air quality concerns, the unresolved mercury loss from the chemical plant that supplied the pulp and paper mill in the 1970s poses contamination risks to the area. ","other_socio_economical_impacts":"The mill\u2019s ongoing impact on Boat Harbour, and it\u2019s new proposal for piping effluent into the Northumberland Strait, pose risk to the local fishing industry. Some argue that industrial development in the area has hampered the coastal tourism industry from flourishing, as it has in other NS communities, and that another spill or a reduction of fishing would further depress the existing tourism industry.  \n The ongoing treatment of the Pictou Landing First Nation throughout the siting of the mill, the process of drastically re-shaping reserve lands to serve as a holding ponds for industrial effluent, the failure to address or compensate for the communities concerns, and the impacts that denigrating the local ecosystem has had on the community\u2019s access and use of their territory for sustenance and cultural practices, are part of a longer history of colonization in Canada. From restricting Indigenous peoples to government designated reserve lands, failing to service Indigenous communities, extracting (often without consultation or compensation) resources from Indigenous lands, and siting environmentally depredating industrial facilities in or near socio-politically and economically marginalized communities, the case of Boat Harbour is an example of ongoing colonial violence facilitated by the state and environmental racism.  ","other_environmental_impacts":" The ongoing contamination and pipeline leaks are primary environmental concerns.  The province of Nova Scotia is now responsible for remediating the site. The 2017 pilot project removed approximately 350,000 cubic meters of contaminated material (Withers, 2017). In addition to contamination, the immediate impact of creating the Boat Harbour holding pond permanently raised water levels by 2-3m and flooded approximately 12 hectares of reserve land. The harbour became devoid of oxygen almost immediately after the treatment facility commenced operation, leading to the death of all aquatic life.

{"other_health_impacts":"Most of the health issues the community faces have to do with nutrition, due to the community\u2019s rural location and previous dependence on a subsistence lifestyle, which is no longer sustainable due to saltwater intrusion into the soil.  Because of the saltwater intrusion, they are no longer able to grow their own food and medicines, and must rely on far-away grocery stores.  This dependence on processed food creates a more unhealthy lifestyle than one that is based on subsistence fishing, hunting, and farming.  Additionally, the Isle de Jean Charles relocated community is highlighted as being close to grocery stores, which will create a greater dependence on these stores.  Hopefully, the community will be successful in their agricultural land on the relocation site and may be able to grow some of the own food while maintaining traditional practices. [4] ","other_socio_economical_impacts":"A major aspect of this relocation project is that, like most instances of climate justice across the world, the effects of climate change cannot be separated from social, political, and economic issues.  Many of the problems the Isle de Jean Charles community face are a direct result of the oil and gas industry, and the need to relocate strips the community of their place-based identity. The decision to relocate was primarily based on cost-benefit analyses, rather than whether or not it was something the community wanted to do.  Ultimately, their tribal leader has maintained that the community has been thinking about relocating for over 15 years, and the federal funding was the means by which they can relocate.  In terms of the oil and gas industry\u2019s impact on the region, these industries claim responsibility for having caused up to 36 percent of wetland loss in Southern Louisiana; however the US Department of the Interior found that the margin of responsibility could be between 15 and 59 percent.  The most visible change the community faces through the relocation process is that they will be separated from their ancestral land and former way of life, including traditional practices such as growing crops and herbal medicines, as well as ties with the land and surrounding water, which allowed them to have a flourishing fishing\/shrimping economy.  Relocating will create change in both their social and economic life.  The goal of the Isle de Jean Charles project is to resettle the entire community as a whole, while keeping the integrity of the community.  Some believe this is simply not possible, based on the community\u2019s heritage and ancestral ties with the land. [8]","other_environmental_impacts":"Although it is hard to predict the environmental impacts of the relocation project itself, it is evident that the Isle de Jean Charles community has dealt with an abundance of other environmental issues.  The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, which was the worst oil spills in United States history, spilled approximately 3.19 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.  This catastrophe affected the Isle de Jean Charles community, as it temporarily destroyed the health of their fishing and shrimping industry and caused changes to the native flora and fauna.  The oil and gas industry has always had a major presence in this region, and much of the land-loss and sea level rise the community has experienced can be directly correlated to the impact of these industries.  For example, drilling of pipelines and wells and construction of canals has drastically affected the way water and sediment moves around the area.  Additionally, removing oil from the ground encourages subsidence, meaning the ground sinks further.  The changes to the landscape have affected the lifestyle of the community members.  In addition to a dependence on the local fishing and shrimping industry, Isle de Jean Charles residents also depended on muskrat trapping as part of their lifestyle.  In addition to the land subsidence, saltwater intrusion into the soil, caused by storms but exacerbated by land loss and erosion, has made it no longer possible for the community to grow their traditional medicinal herbs and vegetation.

{"other_health_impacts":"Stress due to feared seismic activities and reduced trust in the community. There were reports of severe peer pressure against oppositional voices (those that supported the project). After a long period of time, a pollution of ground water tables might result in polluted tab water or negative effects for agriculture. There are reports of such water pollutions but no reports on any related health impact.  ","other_socio_economical_impacts":"According to present mining law (under which all deep geothermal projects are treated) the plaintiff with e.g. a damaged house, resulting from seismic activity, has the burden of proof. It is often difficult to connect a crack in a house to a precise drilling, even when the temporal coincidence points to such a correlation. Local house owners are well aware of the earthquake risks from numerous media reports and the financial risk associated with it. The same burden of proof problem applies to health impacts. German mining law is very much on the side of the developer and offers very little juridical protection for affected people. Even if one plaintiff is successful and receives a compensation, every other house owner has to go to court again, individually.  \nGerman mining law, that has not been changed for decades and hardly applies a precaution principle. It is made in a spirit of technology and mining support, leaving the financial risk rather to the public and affected individuals than putting it to the project developers. The situation with damaged infrastructure and houses in the proximity of open coal mines is very similar. Some individuals achieve compensation but neighbours do not. So the financial risk is very real and people in affected areas are usually well aware of the detrimental juridical situation. \nA third threat is also rather of social nature. Once the permission for mining, under which deep geothermal drillings are treated, is given by the central mining authority of a Land (Landesbergamt), it is difficult if not impossible for a town or village to stop the project, even if the local council and major fully opposes it.  \nThus the only window of opportunity to stop a mining project is in the very beginning, before it starts and before permissions from the central authority are granted. \nSince the drilling in Meiningen did not materialise, all impacts are hypothetical. The impact was purely social, not environmental-physical. \n","other_environmental_impacts":"Like all mining technologies, Geothermal exploration and use comes with the risk of induced seismic activity. However a 100% proof that an earthquake was caused by a drilling, a fracturing process or a running plant is impossible in areas with natural earthquakes. A coincidence, however unlikely, is always a possibility. Even more difficult is the proof that a particular damaged infrastructure or house was caused by a) a seismic event and b) the seismic event by geothermal works. For example an expertise in a court case from Landau, in which a house owner sued the geothermal power plant for compensation, called a connection between the plant and the damaged house \u201cvery unlikely\u201d (Landgericht Landau, Sachverst\u00e4ndigengutachten, 2 OH 10\/12).\nIn total 29 deep geothermal power plants are in service in Germany according to the geothermal association (GtV 2014). Put in relation to the one larger seismic accident in Landau, the ratio of accidents to running plants is 1\/29 or 3,45%.  \nA second argument of the citizen initiative in Meiningen is the threat of ground and drinking water pollution that could be caused by an accident in the drilling process or by leakage of polluted water at the surface. There are reports of drillings that emitted radioactive gas and\/or water at the surface installation of the drilling. Heavy metals contained in the water from drillings are reported. \nDrillings can connect to layers of ground water, inducing a mixing of two underground reservoirs. Possibly water can run off to a deeper level, leaving a cavity that leads to a lowering of the surface (e.g. in Schorndorf). Another threat is an elevation of the surface by accidents in the drilling process (e.g. in Rudersberg-Zumhof). The case of the city Staufen became infamous. The near surface geothermal drilling connected a water reservoir and an underground gypsum layer. The wet gypsum expanded and the surface elevated significantly.  \n(Many of the reported accidents have occurred with near-surface systems. Some could happen in a similar fashion with deep systems, others like the gypsum accident are rather unlikely to happen in deep GT systems) ","slug":"meiningen-deep-geothermal-energy"}
