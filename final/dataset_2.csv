"On April 25, 1998, the containment dam of the pyrite (FeS2) mine settlement pond in Aznalcóllar, Seville, broke. As a result, there was a significant release of acidic water and highly toxic sludge containing high concentrations of heavy metals, with gravely serious consequences for the region. The discharge was about 4.5 Hm3 (3.6 of water and 0.9 of sludge) overflowing onto the banks of the Agrio and Guadiamar rivers over a length of 40 km for the sludge and 10 km for the water, with an average width of about 400 meters. The affected area covered 4,600 hectares. The sludge invaded the outer region of Doñana National Park and flowed into the Guadalquivir in the Coto de Doñana area, finally reaching the relatively less contaminated Atlantic Ocean in Sanlucar de Barrameda. The consequences included 30 tons of dead animals, highly contaminated aquifers, a world record for heavy metal concentration in aquatic birds, and more. After several years, and at a cost of millions of euros spent by various public administrations, the contaminated area was relatively cleaned up. The figure of the Green Corridor natural protection area was established over the damaged area and surrounding expropriated land to connect the Sierra Morena and Doñana. The mine's owner, Boliden-Apirsa, was ordered to pay around 45 million euros in compensation for the damages in 2004. When the Aznalcollar mine tailings dam failed, it released over six million tons of toxic mud and acidic water rich in zinc and arsenic. The mine produced zinc, silver, lead, and copper concentrates extracted from a pyritic ore body, which also contained arsenic, cadmium, thallium, and other elements. The waste was discharged into a large artificial pond, which had an approximate surface area of 1.5 km2, containing about thirty-one million tons of sludge. Around this reservoir, a containment dam had been progressively expanded to increase its capacity. On the day of the disaster, the dam holding the waste broke for a length of about 50 meters, releasing around three million m3 of sludge and four million m3 of acidic waters, contaminating about 4,600 hectares of land along the boundaries of the Doñana National Park and reaching the Guadiamar River. The upper and middle sections of the river were affected by pyritic sludge while the lower section was impacted by acidic waters. Additionally, a containment wall was approved to prevent the spread of the waste to the areas adjacent to the river, namely the Doñana National Park and its marshes. The environmental impact was significant due to the large amount of waste stored in the mine. The main victims were the crops in the lands adjacent to the dam, which were devastated, and the lands themselves became sterile. In terms of flora and fauna, the animals and plants in the Guadiamar River and those relying on it for sustenance were affected, as were the species in Doñana due to the heavy metal contamination. This led the Andalusian Regional Government to expropriate affected lands, marking the first case in Spain of expropriation due to an ecological disaster, and to initiate a rescue, recovery, and rehabilitation plan for the entire basin. This incident attracted attention from the scientific community, leading to numerous projects addressing the issue. In 2001, Boliden ceased mining operations, and the authorities demanded 90 million euros from the company for waste cleanup. In 2002, the 21 technical experts implicated were acquitted, and the Andalusian Regional Government filed a lawsuit against Boliden to recover the 89 million euros spent on waste cleanup, but the Court in Seville declared itself incompetent. In 2004, the Supreme Court ordered Boliden-Apirsa to pay around 45 million euros in compensation for the damages caused. Boliden announced that it would not pay, attributing the accident to an ""external factor."" In 2013, the Andalusian Regional Government approved a decree theoretically allowing the reopening of the mine through a tender excluding the company. This decree has now been appealed to the Constitutional Court. In 2014, the Andalusian Parliament and Government, with the support of parliamentary parties and unions, supported the reopening of the mine. However, environmental organizations such as Ecologists in Action, SEO/BirdLife, and WWF, believe that the decontamination of these water courses and their subsequent regeneration as an ecological corridor – the Green Corridor of the Guadiamar, declared a Protected Landscape and part of the Network of Protected Areas of Andalusia in April 2003 – required a significant investment from the central and regional administrations. Reopening the mine, they argue, poses ""an unacceptable risk"" to the Doñana National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994).

"In 2009, 44 children were reported to have excessive lead levels in their blood in Qingyuan, a prefecture-level city in northern Guangdong province. The children were mostly from 4 months to 3 years old, and the highest blood lead level was up to 550 ug/L [3] (the permissible level of blood lead is below 100 ug/L, according to international standard [9]). Lead poisoning mainly damages the digestive system and blood system, and causes anaemia and dark skin. In severe cases, the nervous system may be damaged. [8] Parents thought that Guangdong Zeliang Battery Manufacturer (later renamed as Guangdong Aokly Power Co., Ltd.) and Jicheng Aluminum Alloy Factory were responsible for the lead pollution due to their close location to the residential area: less than 100 meters. One resident said that the air condition was bad due to the emission of the exhaust air at night, which stimulated eyes and throat, and was unbearable. Two years before 2009, residents living around the manufacturer had appealed several times to the municipal and environmental protection agency for improving the exhaust gas of the factory, but there was no response. [2] On October 26, all the owners of the community entrusted the real estate developer to send a joint letter to the government of Qingyuan, as well as the medical report of some children and the signatures of 221 household owners. They demanded that ""the relevant government departments should rectify factories that pollute the living environment as soon as possible"". [6] They also selected two representatives to be on duty day and night to record the emissions of the two factories in November. However, the environmental protection department did not contact the owners during the period. On November 26, the owners wrote a joint letter again to the Qingyuan Environmental Protection Bureau and the Office of Letters and Calls, and sent the emission record to the relevant departments. [6] It took some time for the government to identify the responsibility of lead pollution. Zeliang Battery Manufacturer had both licenses for business and sewage permit. From the noise and wastewater test report of September 3 (2009), which was issued by Qingyuan Environmental Monitoring Station, the emission indicators of Zeliang Battery Manufacturer met the national standards. [2] On October 21, the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingyuan Economic Development Park received complaints from residents and visited Zeliang Battery Manufacturer and Jicheng Aluminum Alloy Factory. Zeliang Battery Manufacturer promised to complete the rectification about the acid mist in November. [2] On October 29, the bureau received the collective complaint about children's exceeded blood lead from the residents of Guangjin Staff Community. [2] However, in the monitoring report of November 5, both sulphuric acid mist and lead dust were in line with national standards. Journalists found in the report that the content of lead dust, suspended solids, cadmium, and copper in the samples of air and discharged wastewater from Zeliang Battery Manufacturer just reached the critical value. Through more investigations, the Manufacturer was found to pile up large amount of lead and use lots of lead materials in the production process. [2] On December 10, the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingyuan Economic Development Zone found that only half of the machines in the molten lead workshop were in operation, and the workshop was open which made the air in the workshop naturally circulating with the outside air without any protection.  On December 25, the Qingyuan Municipal Government established a group to investigate the excessive blood lead issue. According to the test results of the Qingyuan Environmental Monitoring Station and the Guangzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, the pH value and lead concentration of the wastewater discharged from Zeliang Battery Manufacturer exceeded the ""Water Pollution Emission Limits of Guangdong Province"". [2] The concentration of lead dust in exhaust gas was 9.05 μg/m3 (standard is 7.5 μg/m3). [3] On December 26, the Zeliang Battery Manufacturer was ordered to stop production and sewage. It was determined that the factory was responsible for the lead pollution. The Qingyuan Economic Development Zone, the Qingyuan Environmental Protection Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other relevant departments held a briefing to address the excessive blood lead issue. In order to get the patients to be treated as soon as possible, the government sent an emergency medical team to the scene to carry out treatment work [4]. The government paid for all medical tests to know the exact number of children with excessive blood lead, as well as the recheck and later treatment. The Qingyuan Environmental Protection Bureau was in charge of monitoring all the factories and companies involving lead in the whole economic development park. [3] Yinyuan Industrial Estate was developed and managed by Qingyuan Economic Development Zone. [12] Several years before the lead pollution was detected, it had attracted tens of thousands of migrant workers to work and earn a living. Many people have come also with their families and have purchased an apartment there. Guangjin Staff Community is one of the residential communities. [6] Located in the Yinyuan Industrial Estate, the community was put into use since September, 2005, with 380 apartments, 430 households, and almost 1200 residents. Most families have 2 children, some even have 3 or 4. The number of children was roughly estimated over 1,000. Among them, children under 14 years old were 364. [5] The residential area is 150 meters away from the main production workshop of Guangdong Zeliang Battery Factory. Guangdong Zeliang Battery Manufacturer was located in the Yinyuan Industrial Estate. It was registered in 2004, and expanded the production area from 2 hectares to 3.6 hectares through renting near buildings. The factory had around 500 staff, from which 50 people lived in the Guangjin Staff Community, and 11 of them were the parents of children with excessive lead level of blood. [5] After the exposure of lead poisoning, there was a trend in the area to detect blood lead for children. [3] Although most adults did not go for the blood lead test, but those who did were also reported as excessive blood lead. [4] Children with excessive blood lead have the symptoms of irritable temperament and declining physical condition, and are prone to colds and fever. There were several gray spots on one of child's deciduous teeth, which was one of the symptoms of lead poisoning. [6] Parents received medicine to decrease the lead in their children's blood, while the effect was not significant but with the loss of calcium and zinc at the same time. They know that unless leaving this area, whatever their children took would not help to address their excessive blood lead levels. [4] Some people chose to move or sent their children to their hometown, while most of children were still breathing the polluted air. The lead poisoning also influenced the real estate industry of the area. No one would like to buy an apartment in the area, and the price decreased into the cheapest one in the whole Guangdong Province. [4] According to the government of Qingyuan, there were 4 main reasons of the exceeding blood lead of children. Firstly, the discharge of waste water and exhaust gas from Zeliang Battery Manufacturer exceeded the standard. Secondly, the supervision of pollution source was not in place, and the awareness of workers to protect themselves was weak. The shower and locker rooms were rarely used, and many workers went home without changing their clothes, which caused the direct and indirect lead pollution to their children. Thirdly, the residential area was too close to the pollution source. The real estate developers was responsible for the planning of the buildings. Finally, there were many restaurants and groceries near the Guangjin Staff Community, where the food and toys were easily polluted by the lead and touched by children. [5] Propaganda materials on lead hazards were ready, and the city would effectively carry out publicity and education activities on health care knowledge such as prevention of lead hazards through media and on-site lectures in the Qingyuan Economic Development Zone. [7] On April 27, 2010, the Qingyuan Municipal Government invited relevant experts and unit representatives to conduct a technical review of the feasibility of the Environmental Impact Assessment report about the technical transformation of the Factory. At the meeting, the head of Guangdong Aokly Power Co., Ltd. (a ""new face"" of Guangdong Zeliang Battery Manufacturer) said that during the period of production suspension, the company has relocated  part of its production to Yingde City of Guangdong Province, and was ready to spend two years for the overall relocation. In this period, the company planned to remove the lead dust pollution part from the original production process, and to outsource plates production for battery assembly. [10] While according to the 'Comprehensive remediation plan for lead-acid battery industry in Qingyuan City' (2016-2022), conducted by the Qingyuan Environmental Monitoring Station for all major heavy metal pollution prevention and control enterprises (2013~2015) including Guangdong Zeliang Battery Manufacturer, the heavy metal concentrations (lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium and arsenic) of water and soil have not met the standard requirements, which means the pollution to the environment and human health still exists.

"The Doña Inés de Collahuasi Mining Company is dedicated to the extraction and production of copper concentrate and molybdenum concentrate. The company is owned by the British company Anglo American (44%), the Swiss multinational Glencore (44%), and a consortium of Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (12%). It is located in the north of Chile, 180 km from Iquique, 40 km from the town of Huatacondo, and 130 and 135 km from the towns of Pica and Matilla respectively, surrounded by areas of high biological diversity such as salt flats, wetlands, and peatlands in the region of Tarapacá.  Its production levels, combined with its mineral resources, size, and location, place it among the six largest copper producers in the world and the second largest in Chile. It has one of the largest copper deposits on the planet, with 10,380 million tons. In 2018, it had revenues of $3.241 billion and net profits of $1.014 billion. That same year, Collahuasi produced a quantity of fine copper of 559,147 tons, ""the highest production in its more than 20 years of operation,"" according to its 2018 annual report (the average copper price in 2018 was $2.96 per pound). It is estimated that the deposit has a lifespan of more than 50 years. Currently, it has a total workforce of 5,099 direct and indirect workers.  Collahuasi's expansion will be the largest mining project in Chile and the fourth largest copper operation in the world. It contemplates an investment of USD 6,500 million to produce over one million tons. The operation consists of two main copper porphyry deposits, Ujina and Rosario. Collahuasi has a projected mine life of over 50 years.  The company processes copper sulfide and oxide minerals to produce concentrates and copper cathodes, respectively. Its on-site facilities include open-pit mines, a concentrator plant, an SX-EW plant, and a 200 km pipeline for transporting concentrate from the mine to the port of Punta Patache, about 60 km from Iquique.  Collahuasi is currently working to expand its processing plant and achieve its goal of one million tons of fine copper by 2015. This mine puts the sustainability of the ecosystems in the area and the surrounding communities such as Pica, Mamiña, La Huaica, and La Tirana at serious risk. It is predicted that within 20 years, Iquique will also suffer serious problems. In 2010, an environmental inspector working as a contractor for the mine reported evident impacts that year based on observations they had made on water levels and water samples indicating the presence of contaminants, specifically sulfuric acid. There was also a decrease in water levels in the Laguna del Huasco, located near the Oasis de Pica, which supports a rich diversity of flora and fauna that could potentially be affected by the mining's water usage.  Local farmers in Pica and Matilla oppose the mine, fearing that the water system of Huasco is connected to their water sources. They hang black flags from their small homes because the livelihoods of the Oasis population are at stake. Authorities remain obedient to the power of money. Added to this is the pollution generated by the mining activities. It extends to the coast south of Iquique, where Collahuasi has its own port and a molybdenum processing plant. The locals also fear for their future, not understanding why the law is so permissive. They cite the effects that sustained groundwater extraction would have on the Salares de Michinca and Coposa, both exploited by Collahuasi.  The main concern is that if these water depletion phenomena are happening now, it is dangerous to think about what will happen when Collahuasi doubles its production, and with it, its water consumption. It is worth noting that the mining company, which also processes molybdenum, achieved a historic record in 2009 by processing 535,853 tons of copper (15.4% more than in 2008) and expects to reach one million tons by 2015. The questioning is logical, as not only Collahuasi intends to double its production, but Quebrada Blanca and Cerro Colorado also aim for the same.  In addition, there is the construction of the new pipeline that will pass through an area of the Pampa del Tamarugal National Reserve. On the other hand, mining strikes have been strong and frequent. In 2010, the workers and residents of neighboring coves of the Collahuasi Mine carried out protests due to the damage caused by the molybdenum plant to the atmosphere, affecting their health. Out of the five thousand workers, four thousand are subcontracted by companies that provide services to the Collahuasi mine. Only a thousand have direct employment contracts with the transnational company. The Doña María school in Iquique was occupied, with historical resonances, as in 1907 the nitrate workers held a strike and occupation there, which ended in a massacre by the army.  Conflict with Bolivia  In January 2011, a councilor from Colcha (Bolivia) accused companies mining on the Chilean side of extracting groundwater from Bolivia, causing the drying of the lagoons in southwestern Bolivia. The companies specifically mentioned were Doña Inés de Collahuasi, La Escondida, Codelco, and Soquimich. Faced with this situation, the inhabitants of southwest Potosí announced that they would request the Bolivian Chancellor, David Choquehuanca, to send an investigation mission and include this issue on the bilateral negotiation agenda with the Chilean government. The intention to access groundwater from Potosí was known several years ago, which led the prefect of that time, Daniel Oropeza, and the then president of the Potosí Civic Committee, Mario Rengifo, to be invited by the Inés de Collahuasi company to discuss the possibility of selling groundwater.  The mine also threatens the Salar de Huasco, a wetland at 4,000 meters above sea level. The salt flat and the lagoon are protected by the Ramsar Convention. In recent years, conflicts between communities and the company have not ceased. Some of the most recent are related to the new expansion project of the mine that would affect the environment and the ways of life of the surrounding communities.  Between 2006 and 2008, fishermen and inhabitants of the Chanavayita cove on the coast of Iquique reported intense headaches, vomiting, and discomfort due to strong odors emanating from the plant and the power plant that the company has in Puerto Patache. In January of that year, the communities filed a claim for damages against the mine for the damages suffered. The lawsuit was initially rejected by the Third Court of Iquique. The ruling stated that the damages from alleged sulfuric acid contamination were not proven.  Today, the community is divided between those who continue the lawsuit against the pollution and the health problems caused by the mine, and those who defend the presence of the company in the area. Also, the cause of death of hundreds of sea lions in 2009 in the waters near that plant has not been revealed. They were found dead on the rocks, one on top of the other, showing a strange yellow color, which suggests chemical poisoning.  In 2016, the company was involved in a new environmental emergency in the town of Ujina, inside Iquique, due to the spill of copper concentrate from the rupture of a mining waste channel belonging to a Collahuasi mining operation. The incident was due to the breakage of the tailings pond chute, which immediately forced the suspension of the concentrator plant's operations.  Despite the multiple controversies the company has been involved in, in 2018 the company submitted to the Environmental Assessment System the Infrastructure Development and Production Capacity Improvement Project of the Doña Inés de Collahuasi mining company. Over the next 20 years, the mine is expected to increase its current production of 545,000 tons of fine copper per year to 710,000 tons. The regional environmental authority supported an initiative that continues to concern the communities of Pica and Pozo Almonte. That same year, a modernization project for the facilities was approved to increase its daily production, with an investment exceeding US$300 million. The process, which includes a duration of five years from 2021, includes works for the extension of the tailings deposit and the optimization of the molybdenum plant.  In 2019, the Aymara Indigenous Association of Coposa filed a complaint against the Environmental Superintendent, against the resolution authorizing Collahuasi to extract water for its operations until 2040. The communities denounce the damage this has caused to the Coposa salt flat, located in the Andean plateau in the commune of Pica, Tarapacá Region, affecting the grazing activity traditionally carried out in the Coposa basin, where historically the Aymara people have led a way of life based on grazing, in a unique and characteristic ecosystem. As of today (2020), the conflict remains latent, and the Quechua and Aymara communities continue to confront the mining company for the water resources and environmental damage its operations cause in their territories.

"The Romaine Complex (RC) is a hydroelectric dam project in the North-East of Quebec, first announced in 2004 [1]. Located in the Nitassinan, also known as the Regional Municipal Council of Minganie, construction of the RC started in 2009, with an anticipated completion date of 2021 [2, 3]. The RC is being built on the Romaine River, one of few large rivers in Quebec, and is the second largest construction project in Canada [3]. It is part of a larger Quebecois initiative to expand hydroelectric production and, according to the government, its construction will help meet the goals of Quebec's energy strategy of 2006-2015 [4, 5]. However, construction and operation of the RC also imply large-scale disturbances to the local environment, as well as several social impacts on local indigenous and non-indigenous communities.  Approximately 7,000 people live in the Regional Municipality of Minganie, 5,300 of which are non-indigenous Quebecois and 1,600 of which are indigenous Innu [1]. Both communities were asked to submit reports of their opinions on the RC to the Bureau d'Audience Publique sur l'Environnement (BAPE) - the Department of Public Hearing on the Environment. The non-indigenous Quebecois population, represented by the municipality of Minganie, submitted a report in favor of the project, citing economic and regional development and the influx of jobs around the RC as key reasons for their consent [1].  The indigenous populations, represented by the Innu of Ekuanitshit, Nishipiminan Corporation, the Innu Takuaikan Council, and the Council of the Innu of Ekuitshit submitted largely disfavorable reports arguing that the project would have a severe impact on the environment and affect their fishing, hunting, and picking practices [1]. Indeed, construction of the RC would impact the forest caribou population, the local salmon population, which is sensitive to slight chemical shifts in the water, and water mercury levels, putting several communities' sources of drinking water at risk [3, 4]. The RC would also indefinitely change the landscape around the Romaine River because of mass diversions of various waterways, further impacting indigenous populations by affecting their livelihoods and sources of sustenance but also through impacting their relation to the land and ability to practice their cultural traditions tied to the river landscape [1, 3].  In 2009, the BAPE submitted its own recommendation in favor of the project after considering the reports by both communities [4]. Four indigenous communities, the Nutashkuan, the Pakua Shipi, the Unamen Shipu and the Ekuatshit, finally signed Impact Benefit Agreements with Hydro-Quebec [1]. These agreements included 1) hiring of Innu workers, 2) protection of the fauna and flora, and 3) supporting economic development in the region [1]. These decisions have sewn tensions within the indigenous communities, as several members and even whole communities have persisted in their opposition to the project.  The project's impacts extend beyond the immediate geography of the dam. In 2009, 2 indigenous communities located 200km away from the RC - the Uashat and the Mani-Utenam -  filed a court injunction against transmission lines carrying electricity from the RC that would cross their ancestral lands [3]. In 2012, approximately 200 Innu who had rejected the IBA protested the RC by marching on Route 138 - the main road to one of the construction sites [3]. They were forcibly removed by police a few days later [3]. Another march was organized by Innu women who walked 700 km from Mani-Utenam to Montreal in protest [3]. A roadside encampment was also set up by protestors [3].  Several commentators point out that, while Hydro-Quebec appeared to seek out a regional consensus for the project, they were in fact negotiating individual, separate, and largely behind-closed-door agreements with each community, exacerbating tensions while ensuring that they had enough consent for their purposes [1, 3]. In deciding whether to consent to the RC, communities were also caught between a rock and hard place. On the one hand, unbridled industrial development, embodied in the RC, created worry and uncertainty about the future of their local environment and culture [3]. On the other hand, the RC provided a tangible way to mitigate social issues within the communities such as unemployment and poverty [3]. The government of Quebec and Hydro-Quebec, a state-owned company, have argued for the construction of RC using the frame of sustainable development. Indeed Hydro-Quebec has claimed that it is ""reiterating its commitment to sustainable development by focusing on renewable energy at Romaine Complex, which will help meet current needs without jeopardizing the energy supply of future generations."" [2]. According to resistance groups such as the North American Mega dam Resistance Alliance (NAMRA), new dam construction at the site of the Romaine river is not in fact to meet an increased need for electricity rather than to perpetuate a Quebecois cycle of job creation in remote parts of the province and agreement of engineering contracts with private companies [5]. NAMRA argues that Quebecois economic development has become contingent on hydroelectric development since the 1970s [6].  The government's strategy of revitalizing the economy of Quebec and pushing for a more financially independent and prosperous Quebec through hydroelectric development is reflected in the ""Plan Nord"" - North Plan - policy document, now called ""Le Nord Pour Tous"" - the North for All [7]. This plan has been heavily criticized by both environmental and indigenous rights activists for perpetuating a socially precarious, resource-intensive and wasteful economic model [6, 8].",romaine-complex,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM,NÃO,SIM
"As high levels of carbon dioxide emitted by the Northern hemisphere over the last two centuries have strongly contributed to the climate crisis, carbon emissions have become a commodity. Countries are endorsing climate agreements, committing to decreasing emissions, therefore businesses have had to find alternative ways to continue business as usual [1]. This has led to the creation of carbon offset concessions that generate and sell carbon credits. Ironically, the responsibility for 'reducing' emissions is transferred to small, marginalised populations of the Global South.This conflict concerns the population of Bapinang Hilir and the Indonesian company Rimba Makmur Utama (RMU). The village of Bapinang Hilir is located in the South of the island of Borneo. Despite Bapinang Hilir village being situated outside of the 149,800 hectares concession area, Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) have identified the village within the verified project zone that extends 305,669 hectares, hence the impact on Bapinang Hilir [2]. Concession owners have subsequently profited from this inclusion at the cost of the Bapinang Hilir villagers.The Katingan Peatland Restoration and Conservation Project (Katingan REDD+ project) was set up by Rimba Makmur Utama (RMU). RMU was founded in 2007 with the intention of profiting from forest conservation activities through carbon trading [3]. The Katingan REDD+ Project collaborates with 34 Indonesian villages to avoid emissions approximately equivalent to 7,451,846 tons of CO2 per year by preventing deforestation, forest degradation, wildfires and peat drainage [4]. As the area is rich in biodiversity and home to some of the world's most endangered species, such as the Bornean Orangutan and Proboscis Monkey, the project boast about the benefits for the flora and fauna of the region brought by protecting their ecosystems and promoting sustainable development within the local community [6].As the World Rainforest Movement report [2] states, the project proposal was initially rejected by the village governments - made up of the coconut elites. The rejection was based on rumours circulating that other villages were gradually losing access to their land and forests. RMU then opted to bribe the village governors by providing funds and the decision was subsequently overturned in 2017. A majority of villagers then signed the cooperation agreement with RMU as they were tempted by the financial rewards they assumed would follow as it had done for neighbouring villages [2].  Carbon trading commodifies the vast carbon landscape, but it does not stop there. It creates new spaces where ecology itself becomes a commodity. Carbon credits are calculated based on the scenario of the threat of deforestation from industrial plantation concessions, community cultivation rights and forest encroachment by the community [2]. Hence, the emergence of carbon as one more capitalist commodity dramatically affecting labour and productive relations in the countryside. The project claims to be designed to ensure that all benefits are real, long-lasting, and passed on to local communities [5]. Despite the success that the project was expected to reap, it took the project ten years to obtain its Verified Carbon Standards Certification and social conflict has surfaced as the Katingan Project manages the land and the government owns it [3]. Land that was once 'rightly' owned by villagers according to traditional land tenure systems has been repossessed and people have been cut off. Elite farmers have thrived through the expansion of their coconut plantations and middle class farmers cultivate palm oil.  The many marginal rice farmers are left to use herbicides because they are forbidden to use fire, significantly increasing the costs of growing rice and damaging the soil and water sources [2]. Hence, peasants who once boasted a certain level of autonomy and self-sufficiency have become petty commodity producers. Furthermore, regardless of promises concerning peat preservation, a large oil palm plantation lies east of the project area contributing to draining the peat [3]. In the long term, this will lead to wildfires, and herein lies the controversy. In the case of wildfires, the carbon credits sold remain valid, hence polluting the atmosphere twofold. As the responsibility to decrease emissions shifts to rural areas, carbon concessions do not reduce overall emissions but simply compensate for pollution elsewhere. Some say that this is better than nothing, but others believe it is worse than nothing as carbon credits enable companies that claim to be 'carbon neutral' to continue business as usual [3]. For instance, Shell lures consumers with advertisements promising they can ""drive carbon neutral with Shell"" because the company contributes to projects like Katigan [6]. In fact, this case demonstrates the commodification of nature and human beings in addition to the vast carbon landscape [2]. This is achieved at the expense of local communities, their ecosystems and their traditional ways of life. The REDD+ project's positive impact is therefore questioned with regards to natural factors such as the reduction of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the rate of deforestation, but also with regard to the marginalized local communities restructured at the expense of the Global North and its greatest polluting multinationals such as Shell and KLM.",katigan-peatland-conservation-excluding-traditional-owners-indonesia,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO,NÃO
"Maro in Malaga, Spain is a natural area of ​​great historical, cultural and landscape value, bordering the Maro-Cerro Gordo Cliffs Natural Park and the Tejeda and Almijara Mountains Natural Park [1]. The site is also protected by UNESCO as a cultural heritage [1,2].In addition, this is an area of ​​Special Agricultural Protection, on which about 150 farmers work the land in a sustainable and traditional manner for generations. The farmers also formed a cooperative [2]. On March 23, 2020, only few days after a lockdown for Covid-19 was declared in Spain, local authorities announced that a 200 sq meters urban project will take place on the area, and would include a golf field, a 5-star hotel and 680 luxury apartments [1,2,3] by the real estate company called  Sociedad Azucarera Larios (Salsa) [1]. However, farmers, citizens, and activists said that this urban project is ""paying the debts"" the City of Nerja has with the ""Larios"" (Spanish landlords, Spanish industrial family and protagonist of the industrialization of Málaga) for the land use [3]. ""It is like an extortion"" the activist stated and continued: ""if you don't approve my real estate project, you have to pay me for the land"". ""A City Council cannot and should not exchange debts for urban development favors"" [3]. Local communities and activists also stated that this project is highly unsustainable in ecological, economic and social terms: ""It is a speculative process"". We are talking about land enclosure"" [3]. Furthermore, this is a protected area with high cultural value as well [2,3]. Larios on the other hand, argue how traditional and unregulated agriculture affect the landscape negatively (especially numerous greenhouses) and that a golf yard would contribute to the area with a ""green"" visual aesthetics [3,7]. Farmers, citizens and environmental activists, therefore, formed a collective called ""Otro Maro y Nerja es possible"", which stands for the protection of social, natural and traditional economies ​​of the province of Nerja [4]. The collective is centered on protecting the landscape patrimony which they have been engaged with for generations: 400 years of traditional agricultural practices [2,3]. The activists continue with their protest so that the City Hall does not approve the project [2,3]. As well they are proposing different economic and sustainable alternatives for the local communities [4]",urban-development-project-in-maro-malaga-spain,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"In January 2014 the U.S. Navy reported to the Hawaii Department of Health that approximately 27,000 gallons (102,000 liters) of jet fuel had leaked from an underground tank at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, which supplies fuel to Pearl Harbor naval base. The leak raised serious concerns over the risk of contamination spreading to important water supplies. The fuel facility consists of 20 tanks and is located just 100 feet (30 meters) above an aquifer that hundreds of thousands of residents living in and around Honolulu depend upon for their fresh drinking water.[1] Officials from the Hawaii Department of Health and Honolulu Board of Water Supply inspected the fuel facility and were able to see the leaking tank, tank 5, first-hand. Documents filed with the health department showed that there had been a previous leak at the Red Hill facility in 2001-2002 with efforts to undertake follow-up monitoring. Reports indicated that even at that time the state had doubts over the adequacy of the monitoring system for preventing fuel from getting into drinking water. Detecting and repairing a leak from underground tanks is far more difficult than with above-ground facilities.[2] In April 2014, as contractors began to inspect the tank and the Navy sought a contractor to 'define the nature, extent and magnitude of soil and groundwater contamination beneath Tank 5', Honolulu City Council members joined a chorus of officials urging the Navy to make improvements to prevent what the Honolulu Board of Water Supply warned could be a serious hazard to the water supply if a powerful earthquake in the area were to disturb the ground. The Board of Water Supply and Hawaii Department of Health said that, to date, there were no indications that fuel had contaminated the groundwater aquifer, but elevated levels of hydrocarbons had been detected in soil vapor samples at nearby monitoring points. There were particular concerns over the possible threat to two wells, Halawa Shaft and and Moanalua Shaft, accounting for 25 per cent of the water supply to the area between the residential neighbourhoods of Moana-lua and Hawaii Kai. And a long history of fuel leaks from the Red Hill facility came to light. Water officials said the Navy had reported dozens of fuel releases, adding up to a volume of about 1.2 million gallons (4.45 million liters), but the Health Department had not informed Board of Water Supply officials until the most recent leak was being discussed.[3] A Navy report from 2010 had suggested that fuel contamination might be moving in the direction of country drinking water supplies.In June 2014 Ernest Lau, chief engineer at the Board of Water Supply, expressed concern at the slow pace of action to address the jet fuel leak. The process of draining the tank and airing out the fumes had taken several weeks; inspection of the tank walls and bottom could only commence only after this had been completed. Lau and other health officials said that a more extensive well monitoring programme might be needed and that only two of four test wells, specified in a USD1.5 million contract awarded on 22nd May, had been drilled. The Health Department was expected to release an 'enforcement remedy' for the Navy to address contamination concerns but there was uncertainty over whether such an agreement would be legally binding. Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility was exempt from federal leak detection and prevention requirements that most underground fuel systems had been subject to since the 1980s. It was noted that hydrocarbon levels in soil vapor beneath Tank 5 had jumped to 225,000 parts per billion at the time the leak was detected in January 2014, triple the highest ever level recorded under the tank since sampling began in 2008.[4]On June, in the course of testing to determine whether air could flow through the tank wall, workers found three tiny holes, too small to see with the naked eye, which could be the source of the leak. More information about the long history of fuel leaks emerged. Over the 70 years since construction of the facility all of the 20 tanks had leaked. Petroleum-contaminated rock was found under 19 of the tanks while Navy records indicated that the remaining tank had leaked at some point. Gary Gill, the state Department of Health's deputy director for the environment said the department knew that groundwater immediately below the tanks had been contaminated by petroleum but did not know how far or in which direction the contamination plume had travelled.[5] The Navy pinpointed the source of the fuel leak upon completion of 'vacuum-box' testing to find out where air was flowing under the wall of the underground tank. Fifteen defects, tiny holes that might have been caused by recent maintenance works, were discovered. A total of 45 areas of Tank 5's walls appeared to be 'suspect'.[6] 21st February 2018 marked a victory for the Sierra Club's research, campaigning and advocacy work to address the Red Hill fuel leaks and protect water supplies from contamination. A court ruled in favour of the Sierra Club, finding that the state's exemption of the Red Hill fuel tanks violates state law. The Sierra Club lawsuit was based upon a 1992 state law directing the Health Department to enact rules requiring the upgrading of existing underground storage tanks to prevent releases of petroleum into the environment. Instead of complying with this mandate the Department of Health had exempted Red Hill from regulation, in spite of its admission that ""the storage of up to 187 million gallons of fuel, 100 feet above a drinking water resource is inherently dangerous"". The new ruling meant that the fuel tanks must be brought into compliance with state law. Sierra Club of Hawai'i director Marti Townsend said: ""This is a big deal. The Navy can no longer skirt our laws. Its time to fix up the Red Hill fuel tanks or shut them down...The future of O'ahu's drinking water is looking much clearer.""[7] In December 2018 Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi published a fact sheet about the Red Hill fuel tanks. Almost five years after the major leak was discovered no leaked fuel had been located or cleaned up. The tanks had not been fixed and it could not be guaranteed that more leaks would not occur. The condition of the fuel tanks was worse than anticipated. Areas of the steel walls had thinned far more than predicted. Originally the steel walls were 0.12 inches (6.35mm) wide. The thinnest samples were less than a third of the original width measuring just 0.079 inches (2mm). The Sierra Club disagreed with the Navy's preferred option of maintaining the current tank system. Its proposals, such as re-coating the bottom of the tanks with epoxy, were almost identical to the repair efforts over the preceding 13 years, i.e. the least protective and least expensive options. Concerned that the corroding tank walls could result in further fuels leaks, and noting the lack of a plan to ensure protection of water sources, the Sierra Club argued that the Red Hill facility should be shut down and relocated far away from drinking water supplies.[8] Lack of geological knowledge about the ground under the fuel tanks resulted in a lack of understanding about water flows and inability to predict how leaks would spread. AECOM, an international firm with many military contracts, developed a computer model of what the ground under the facility might look like and some deep holes were drilled in an attempt to learn more about the geology under the facility, but it is vast and complex and there are still important gaps in knowledge. A 2008 study conducted by Ohio-based TEC Inc. spent USD120,000 researching options for secondary containment and leak detection technology. This study also provided helpful information about the leak history. After the 2014 leak the Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility Task Force was established, a body composed of the Hawaii Department of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Navy, Honolulu Board of Water Supply, the Department of Land and Natural Resources, one member from the state Senate and two members from the community. The task force studied the 2008 report and other documents and made a number of recommendations related to transparency and the need for more diligent research, including a scientific peer review and evaluation of sampling and detection methods. Letters to the US Navy from the EPA, Hawaii Department of Health and Hawaii Board of Water Supply outlined concerns that these recommendations had not been adequately addressed.[9] In March 2019 Honolulu City Council called on regulators to ensure better protection against water contamination from Red Hill fuel tank leaks. Council members agreed with the Honolulu Board of Water Supply that the Navy's plan for a single-wall upgrade of 18 deteriorating jet fuel tanks puts Honolulu's water supplies at risk. A resolution was passed urging the EPA and Hawaii Health Department to require the Navy to either use a secondary containment tank or relocate the fuel storage facility altogether.[10]",red-hill-underground-fuel-storage-facility-jet-fuel-leak,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"The West Coast National Park was established in 1985 to conserve a globally important centre of biodiversity, including the Langebaan Lagoon, which is a UN Ramsar site, or a wetland of international importance. The area is also home to several internationally important plant species. Elandsfontein is additionally extremely rich in fossils [4]. Yet the area is also South Africa's second largest phosphate deposit, which drew the attention of mining company Kropz, formerly known as Elandsfontein Exploration and Mining Ltd. and partially owned by African Rainbow Capital. Kropz claimed the mine would bring 300 new permanent jobs. However, from the beginning, local environmental groups, residents, and state departments opposed the company [3].In 2011, the Department of Mineral Resources rejected the initial prospecting permit because ""the proposed prospective activities fall within a Critical Biodiversity Area."" Kropz appealed against this, claiming that the critical biodiversity areas ""have not been adopted in terms of the National Environmental Management Act"". The Elandsfontein mining area is also not classified as ""critically endangered"" and is only classified as ""vulnerable"" according to the Act. The Minister of Mineral Resources then granted the prospecting right in 2013. In late 2014, the Environmental sub-directorate recommended rejecting Kropz's application for a mining right, saying that ""the granting of this right would only result in unacceptable pollution, avoidable ecological degradation or damage to the environment."" The Department of Water Affairs was also ""not in favor of mining rights being allowed... due to the impact on the ground water resources"" [3]. Governmental conservation organisation Cape Nature, public entity Heritage Western Cape, and the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning also lodged objections with the Department of Mineral Resources [2].On November 26, 2014, Kropz was granted a license to mine phosphate next to the West Coast National Park, as well as a water use license in April 2017 [4, 10]. The Elandsfontein mine is about 3km from where the fossilised remains of the Saldanha Man were found. Environmental activist groups such as GroundUp and the West Coast Environmental Protection Association (WCEPA) as well as state departments such as the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning both pursued court action against these licenses. However, Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa rejected these appeals despite acknowledging that ""Kropz's mining activity was unlawful when it first commenced and continues to be unlawful to the extent that such mining activity is ongoing"" [3]. Subsequently, various environmental groups took the Department of Mineral Resources to the High Court to appeal once more [5]. In June 2015, the Centre for Environmental Rights accused Kropz of exploiting a string of inconsistent regulatory decision making by government officials as well as various delays and loopholes to construct the mine before a decision on the appeal was finalized, circumventing their oblications under the One Environmental System [1]. Internal documents from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) as well as a DMR whistleblower also indicated that Kropz received the permits unlawfully, did not complete its paperwork and application, and had been getting favorable treatment from the DMR while other mines with similar circumstances had been outright refused [2, 10].In October 2016, Kropz approached the DMR for permission to extend phosphate mining operations into the West Coast National Park itself, run by South African National Parks (SANParks). As it is illegal to mine in a national park, the land would first have to be deproclaimed before mining could take place. WCEPA suspected Kropz of building infrastructure designed for much more output than current mine agreements. Moreover, as WCEPA lawyer Walter Anderson added, ""If SANParks gives an inch, there will be a landslide of mining applications in our national parks. They will come down on Kruger [National Park] and others which are known to have valuable mineral deposits"" [4]. SANParks, however, agreed to the extension despite initially objecting it after consulting with several specialists over the past year advising against mining in such a sensitive area. Kropz's own impact analyses also found that the mining would have medium to high risk of destroying valuable underground fossils even with measures in place to mitigate loss. SANParks has not responded to GroundUp's questions about why the objections were withdrawn, despite numerous requests [3]. The Kropz project is also controversial because it threatens the ecosystems and livelihoods dependent on the Elandsfontain aquifer and Langebaan Lagoon. The Saldanha Bay Municipality had agreed to allow Kropz to take 1.6 million liters of water from the aquifer daily for its strip-mining operations, which are particularly destructive to the environment as well as lead to acid mine tailings and groundwater pollution [12]. However, Kropz's water use license does not allow taking water directly from the aquifer, the municipality cannot support such a large amount of water taken away, and there were various technical issues in making the infrastructure to draw the water [6]. WCEPA and Cullinans & Associates, a legal firm helping WCEPA fight Kropz, stated on August 15, 2017 that , ""It is notable and concerning that the Saldanha Bay Municipality's resolution focuses almost exclusively on how the Western Cape droughts have affected industry, when one would expect drinking water and sustainable use of water resources to be first priority"" in drought-prone and water-scare regions such as the West Coast, and that ""right from the start, Kropz had acted recklessly by establishing the mine without the necessary permits and contingencies"" [13].On September 11, 2019, Kropz appeared before the South African Water Tribunal at a hearing to determine if it would keep its water license [7]. WCEPA had been pushing for this hearing for five years, still insisting that the license was awarded improperly [8]. WCEPA additionally argued that water use licenses must be suspended under the National Water Act once appeals to the government are lodged, lasting until the appeal decision is finalized. However, Kropz's license had not been suspended [11]. Moreover, the water licence has several conditions, one of which is that Kropz establish by June 2017 a water monitoring committee of 11 entities, including SANParks, state departments and civic bodies, to monitor the dewatering and recharge process and assess whether the aquifer was sufficiently protected. Kropz did not do so. Kropz was also required to test the system of artificial recharge of the aquifer for two months before any mining could take place. But according to court papers, Kropz started mining before it had a water licence, thus violating the license's terms before it was even awarded [11].Kropz has suspended operations as of July 2019 tentatively until the end of 2020 or 2021 owing to technical reasons and because phosphate prices are at a ten-year low [4, 10]. Kropz is also considering phosphate projects in the Republic of Congo and Ghana [7].",kropz-phosphate-mine-in-west-coast-national-park-elandsfontein-south-africa,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"Nuclear power in Taiwan accounts for 5,000 MWe of capacity (3  plants with 6 reactors), i.e. around 8% of its national energy consumption, and 19% of its electricity generation as of 2015. A Fourth Plant was built near Taipei but is stalled since 2014.  There are plans to shut all nuclear reactors by 2025 (as in Germany and South Korea). [6].Organized action against nuclear power can be found in Taiwan as far back asChernobyl in 1986, during a time when anti-nuclear and pro-democracy forces found common cause in opposing the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT). The KMT, which ruled Taiwan under martial law for decades, had constructed three nuclear power plants, with designs for a fourth underway. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) incorporated opposition to nuclear energy into their political platform, and as such, many activists were encouraged when the DPP's Chen Shui-bian won the 2000 election. Their hope was that the transfer of power would not only end a half-century of continuous KMT rule but terminate Taiwan's nuclear energy program for good.Indeed, Chen's administration halted construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant immediately after coming into power. However, the hope proved short lived. Months later, Chen walked back on his promise and allowed construction of the plant to resume. The move  slowed the momentum of the anti-nuclear campaign. (1).As reported by WISE in May 2014 [5] Taiwan's government finally halted construction of the country's fourth nuclear power plant as a result of sustained public opposition and protest. Premier Jiang Yi-huah from the governing Kuomintang Party (KMT) announced on April 27, 2014 that one of the two General Electric-Hitachi Advanced Boiling Water Reactors at the Lungmen plant will be 'sealed' once safety checks are complete and before loading fuel, and construction of the second reactor – now 90% complete − will be halted immediately. Almost US$10 billion has been spent on the plant so far. There had been mass protests against nuclear power in Taiwan since the Fukushima disaster. In March 2013, around 200,000 Taiwanese people had participated in anti-nuclear protests. In March 2014, about 80,000 people protested against the Lungmen plant (and nuclear power generally) around the time of the Fukushima anniversary. In the days before the Premier's April 27 announcement, tens of thousands of protesters (some reports say 30,000, some say 50,000) broke through a police cordon and staged a sit-in along a main street near the central train station in Taipei. Following the announcement, many protesters left but hundreds remained, and police used water cannon to disperse them on Monday morning. More than 40 people suffered minor injuries. Five days before the April 27 2014 announcement, former Taiwanese opposition leader Lin Yi-hsiung, who led the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) from 1998−2000, began a hunger strike to protest against the Lungmen plant. On April 30, Lin ended his fast and said: ""Over the past half month, the people of Taiwan's outstanding display has been unprecedented, which leaves one feeling moved, full of admiration and deeply appreciative. Nuclear opponents should take a step forward to ensuring the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 nuclear power plants are closed on schedule."" The anti-nuclear protests followed other major mass campaigns, including a campaign that successfully pressured the government to stop construction of a petrochemical plant. The greatest single reason for opposition to the nuclear plant is that Taiwan is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire. After several attempts at holding referendums on the fate of the so-called Fourth Nuclear Plant and mass demonstrations, the decision was taken to stop the plan even though it was finished and the fuel rods had been uploaded. By 2018 the issue was degrading into farce as German ""experts"" proposed that the Fourth Nuclear Plant be converted into a theme park (on the model of the stopped nuclear plant at Kalkar in Germany). Thus, it was reported that ""German experts in nuclear power suggested that Taiwan can consider giving a new lease of life to the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant (龍門核電廠), better known as the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant (核四), through transforming it into a theme park after it's decommissioned. With the first batch of the plant's fuel rods exported to the U.S. from Keelung Port on Jul. 4, and the rest scheduled to be removed from Taiwan by 2020, the fate of the energy generator never put into operation has sparked much discussion.A solution was put on the table by a group of German professionals from six corporations and institutions, who are visiting Taiwan in a program jointly organized by German Trade Office Taipei and Baden-Wurttemberg International. According to Oskar Grozinger, former head of the Nuclear Energy Supervision and Radiation Protection Department in Germany, the Kalkar nuclear power plant in Germany serves as a good example, which was completed but never put into service before it was repurposed to become a theme park called ""Wunderland Kalkar.""[2].The debate continues however, with some voices still in favour of putting the Fourth Nuclear Plant in operation. It seems that the main issue in 2018 is what to do with the unranium fuel rods. Press reports [3] of July 2018  stated that Taiwan's state power company has dodged questions about the fate of 1,700-plus fuel rods containing uranium pellets after its ill-fated No-4 nuclear plant on the outskirts of Taipei was mothballed amid a groundswell of public opposition and the government's plan to phase out nuclear-power generation. The island's national grid operator, known as Taipower, has jsaid it has a three-year plan to process the bundles of unused fuel rods. There have been reports that General Electric, the contractor for the plant's reactors, demanded that all rods be returned for disposal. The Taipei-based United Daily News revealed earlier this week that Taipower had already shipped 80 such rods from Keelung port and a second batch of 120 rods was expected to be sent in September.The paper said a US subcontractor,the North Carolina-based Global Nuclear Fuel Americas LLC, had been appointed and would be responsible for dismantling and storing the rods.",lungmen-nuclear-power-plant-nuke-4-taiwan,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Environmental protection was not on the list of priorities of the communist Polish authorities, which ruled in 1944-1989. During the years of intense industrialization, the subject of air and water poisoning was known only to a small group of scientists. In turn, environmental organizations operated practically throughout this period. However, they functioned to a limited extent, not exposing themselves to dignitaries [9].In the 1970s, the financial condition of the state was good, mainly due to taking out foreign loans. In 1971, the decision was made to build the first Polish nuclear power plant. By 2000, it was planned to build a few more plants of this type. In 1972 its location was established in the northern part of Pomerania, on Lake Żarnowieckie, on the land of the village of Kartoszyno. The future nuclear power plant - next to the pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant that was being built at that time - was to be a pillar of the new industrial area. The plans for the development of nuclear energy that were outlined at that time of inception were unrealistic [9].The decision to build the Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant (EJŻ) was made by the Council of Ministers only on January 18, 1982, one month after the imposition of martial law (until July 22, 1983) [11]. The construction work started in spring. However, this next great socialist construction was not accompanied by enthusiastic moods. During the martial law period (shortages of everyday products, repressions) hardly anyone was interested in it. The construction plans, however, aroused opposition from the very beginning from part of the society, especially the population living near the power plant itself [10].The first protests against the construction of the EJŻ took place at the end of 1984 when work on the construction of the main building of the power plant began. The organizer was the Polish Ecological Club. However, they could not take too harsh forms and mainly boiled down to creating protest lists sent to the authorities and collecting information on the potential ecological effects of the construction. Such actions did not have a greater impact on society [10].In the following years, with the development of the anti-communist opposition and the growing economic crisis, the activities of Polish environmental organizations began to take on a political dimension. Moreover, on April 26, 1986, at the nuclear power plant named after W.I. Lenin, a catastrophe took place in Chernobyl (Ukraine) - there was a steam and hydrogen explosion that destroyed the reactor building. From that moment, Poles became interested in what was actually built on the shores of Lake Żarnowieckie. On the one hand, there is an increase in the ecological awareness of a part of the society, on the other - the fear of this investment is spreading. There was a clear escalation of the conflict around the EJŻ [1] [3] [4] [9].The first active group in the protest campaign was Ecological Movement of St. Francis of Assisi (established in 1981 in Krakow, two years after John Paul II proclaimed Saint Francis the patron saint of ecologists). From 1986 to 1988, this organization organized a series of lectures presenting the potential risks associated with the construction of a nuclear power plant. Moreover, the inhabitants of Pomerania were particularly active - after all, they would be the first victims of a possible catastrophe. In this context, it is worth mentioning the activities of local scientific and ecological communities. Gdańsk Ecological Forum, which together with the Gdańsk Scientific Society organized scientific sessions (mini-conferences) devoted to, inter alia, the ecological, economic, and social aspects of the development of nuclear energy. Since 1988, the Forum has also organized public resistance campaigns (demonstrations, sending letters to the authorities, throwing leaflets in the Tri-City), aimed at forcing the authorities to abandon the continuation of the construction of EJŻ and discontinue the development of nuclear energy in Poland. This group started a wave of street protests, which were joined by nationwide organizations of a pacific character, such as the ""Freedom and Peace"" movement (WiP; founded in 1985). Their important feature, distinguishing them from most environmental movements, was their illegal and radical nature. These groups were able to include part of the society in the resistance movement. It was not difficult at the time, because Poles (especially young people) eagerly used any excuse to protest against the communist government [8].On February 6 - April 5, 1989, the Polish Round Table Talks took place, including negotiations within the framework of the Ecology Round Table Subgroup. The government initiated talks with the banned trade union ""Solidarity"" and other opposition groups in an attempt to defuse growing social unrest. Among others, activists of the Polish Ecological Club and activists from the Ecological Movement of St. Francis of Assisi participated in the Round Table [2]. The only controversial issue during the meetings was the construction of the EJŻ. There was even a protocol of disagreement on this matter (the only one at the Round Table).At the beginning of 1989, a WiP congress was held in Poznań, during which the ""nationwide campaign against nuclear energy"" was announced. Its main assumption was protest actions organized in every city where there was a movement [9] [10]. On February 24, 1989, at Długi Targ (square in the old town) in Gdańsk, a meeting of many groups took place - from the Confederation of Independent Poland, the ""Twe Twa"" Movement, to the anarchist Alternative Society Movement. The WiP movement prepared several banners for the demonstration with the slogans: ""Down with Żarnowiec - we want to live"" or ""Chernobyl ass"". The protest petition was read. About 1,000 people took part in the demonstration. The first anti-nuclear march did not go far, as the demonstrators were blocked by a cordon of Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia (ZOMO; paramilitary-police formations during the communist era in Poland). The demonstration was considered successful, which encouraged the organizers to intensify their activities. At this meeting, it was decided to meet at the same place every Friday at 4pm until the government's plans were knocked out. The choice of the date was not accidental: according to the law in force at the time, the militia could detain the protesters for 48 hours, later the court would have to charge them. However, this rarely happened, so if you were detained on a Friday afternoon, you would go out on a Sunday evening in the worst case, without any problems with absence from school, university or work [4] [5] [8].More and more participants took part in illegal demonstrations in the Old Town of Gdańsk every week. They chanted the following slogans: ""Żarnowiec tomb!"" Or ""A better tractor than a reactor!"". Some of them took the form of happenings. This was the case on March 10, 1989, when some of the organizers dressed up in animal masks (hare, fox, cat), others in white aprons. In addition, people put on masks with the image of Lenin, a cardboard nuclear reactor was built, a ""mutant match"" was organized, etc. On April 7, after the militia were called to disperse, the youth began chanting: ""Change the record!"" and throwing vinyl records at the police cordon. On April 28, a delegation of protesters met with a representative of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR; communist party, which ruled the Polish People's Republic as a one-party state). The result of the meeting was the consent to hold a public debate among supporters and opponents of the construction of the power plant. Activists decided it was a success because the authorities recognized them as a group [5].On May 19, 1989, the promised debate took place at the International Press and Book Club at Długi Targ (Gdańsk). The discussion covered issues related to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant, economic issues related to the construction of the power plant, and the issue of environmental protection during its operation. There was a sharp exchange of views, but the meeting itself did not bring any results. At the end of the meeting, representatives of the Anti-Atomic Federation, WiP, Alternative Society Movement, FMW, Confederation of Independent Poland, Ecological Movement of St. Francis of Assisi, ""I Prefer To Be"" Movement presented negative positions on the construction of EJŻ [5].The last Friday demonstration before the summer holidays was held on June 16, 1989. Weekly meetings were suspended during the summer break in school. In general, even then, demonstrations became less and less numerous, because people who protested mainly for political, not environmental reasons, stopped coming [5] [8]. It was on June 4, 1989, that communism ended in Poland - the first parliamentary elections after World War II - partially free - were held.After the start of the school year (in Poland, the beginning of September), the organization of demonstrations in Gdańsk resumed. Generally, thanks to the involvement of the WiP Movement, the fight against the construction of the EJŻ has acquired a national dimension. On October 31, a group of WiP participants from all over Poland and the youth from the ""Twe-Twa"" Movement started a several-day anti-nuclear picket in the capital (in Warsaw) in front of the seat of the Council of Ministers. The participants of the picket handed out leaflets informing passers-by about the purpose of the protest. On November 3, there was an ecological rally in front of the Ministry of Industry and on November 9, a demonstration at the end of the picket in front of the headquarters of the Council of Ministers. During those days, the government postponed the decision on the future of nuclear energy [5].On September 12, 1989, the first Polish government was established after the fall of communism. The fact that the continuation of the construction of the power plant is also taken into account by the post-communist authorities, the public could see on November 15, when two reactors made according to the Soviet technology, intended for Żarnowiec were delivered to the Gdynia port from Czechoslovakia (via combined road, river - Danube and sea transport - from the port of Constanta in Romania). The ""Freedom and Peace"" Movement together with the FMW, the ""Twe-Twa"" Movement, the Greens Federation and the ""I Prefer To Be"" Movement organized a picket in front of the Container Terminal in Gdynia the next day against the delivery of reactors. One terminal corridor was occupied and picketers spread out sleeping bags and blankets. Outside, banners with the following slogans: ""We do not want Chernobyl"", ""New government - old mistakes?"", ""Żarnowiec, a tomb of the economy,"" etc. The Port branch of the trade union Solidarity called on its members to boycott and not to participate in the transshipment [5].The activists faced the harsh reality of the place: the shipping terminal covers an area of ​​several hectares with at least a few entrance gates. They helped activists, among others, by local residents who brought food and let them bathe in their apartments. After a few days of blockades and after negotiations with the terminal authorities, a consensus was reached on the presence of the demonstrators: they received hot drinks from the canteen, were admitted to the terminal area (near the gates), and they could also observe the gates from the offices of some officers [8].On November 19, 1989, 13 participants of the picket undertook a ten-day hunger strike. It ended during a demonstration that took place on November 30 in Gdańsk. The participants of the picket and hunger strike presented demands to stop the construction of a nuclear power plant and called for a local referendum on EJŻ. On that day, activists of the ""Freedom and Peace"" Movement in Warsaw hung a banner ""Żarnowiec is a grave for the other world"" in the Sejm (the lower house of the national parliament). Support for starving youth was expressed on November 27 by the Commission for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Citizens' Committee under the chairman of NSZZ ""Solidarity"" Lech Wałęsa [5].In December 1989, resistance to the construction of the power plant took its most dramatic form. On December 7, five people (four men and one woman) undertook an indefinite fast. Later, other people joined them. Both Lech Wałęsa and the Archbishop of Gdańsk were against the hunger strike. Three days later, a ten-day information picket began at the Gdynia Główna railway station, during which 185,550 USD and 10,000 signatures were collected for the motion to abandon the construction. All collected funds were allocated to publishing activities. The picket was organized, among others, by Fighting Solidarity in the Tri-City, which used the collected funds for publishing activities [5].Despite the ongoing picket at the Container Terminal, the employees of the EJŻ were able to remove the reactor components on December 14th. On this occasion, physical violence was used against the youth, they were pushed, kicked, and dragged along the ground. Later, on December 20, in Gdynia, opponents of the construction of the Żarnowiec NPP organized a rally for the inhabitants of the Tri-City. On the other hand, a day later, on the initiative of WiP, ""Twe-Twa"" and ""I Prefer To Be"" Movements, a picket was organized at the main railway station in Gdańsk. During the session on December 22 and 23, 1989, the Council of Ministers decided to suspend the construction of the EJŻ for at least one year. However, the government argued its decision not with a wave of social protests, but with the poor economic situation of the state [5].Meanwhile, in the Student House No. 3 in Gdańsk-Oliwa, after the announcement of the government's decision, the hunger strike continued. The protesters spoke by phone to the then Minister of Industry. It confirmed the belief that the authorities did not have a clearly defined opinion on the further fate of Żarnowiec. In such a situation, they decided that the suspension of the construction of the power plant for one year actually meant its further continuation. They expressed this in an open letter addressed to the Prime Minister on December 26, signed by the hunger strikers. The protesters spent Christmas together. The hungry were supported by the Ecological Movement of St. Francis of Assisi, which organized medical care for them [5].The protests against the construction of the EJŻ gained new dynamics in January 1990. Taking advantage of the wave of public enthusiasm during political changes, the leaders decided to use a democratic tool - a referendum. The referendum procedure on the future of Żarnowiec was initiated on January 17, 1990 at a meeting of the Provincial National Council (until May 1990, such elements of the old system were still in use). Three days later, young people from Gdańsk ended their hunger protest that had been going on for 44 days! This was due to the declaration of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association, the Ecological Forum and the Catholic Intelligence Club concerning the holding of a referendum on Żarnowiec together with the local elections announced for May 1990 [5] [8].The referendum vote was preceded by extensive leaflet campaigns by Gdańsk environmental organizations and independent organizations. As part of this propaganda initiative, easy-to-read (but untrue) statements were largely used about the plans to install a reactor identical to that used in Chernobyl in Żarnowiec, about ""deep-sea tectonic movements"" that would lead to the rupture of the upper reservoir of the pumped-storage power plant and flooding nuclear power plant, or about the inevitable radioactive contamination of the lake resulting from the use of an open cooling system. Moreover, there were rallies; young people organized special rock concerts. However, just before the upcoming elections, it turned out that it was in danger. The then-election commissioner announced a week before the planned referendum that it could not be held on the premises and in front of committees. The organizers' determination and the support of the public demanding the closure of the Żarnowiec power plant resulted in the organization of 599 premises and as many commissions [5] [8].Local elections and a referendum were held on May 27, 1990. 44.3% of Pomeranian eligible voters voted in the referendum, 86.1% were against the continuation of construction, and 13.9% were in favor. The required 50% voter turnout for the referendum was not exceeded for it to become binding. This result confirmed that the public had become listless and tired, but at the same time opposed to the idea of ​​building a power plant. Activists proved that they are not alone in their struggle and that they are not extremists who want to impose their will on society by fasting (as suggested by the authorities and the media). It is worth mentioning that the referendum committees were attended by representatives of independent local organizations (e.g. Kashubian-Pomeranian Association), the League for Nature Conservation, and people from the ""Solidarity"" printing house [5] [8].After the unsuccessful referendum, there were protests in which, unlike the actions of 1988 and 1989, the inhabitants of the vicinity of the investment participated mainly. Residents periodically blocked access roads to the construction site with tractors and agricultural machinery, and as a result, the construction of the power plant was practically paralyzed. In turn, the anarchists continued their demonstrations in Gdańsk. Moreover, activists changed their strategy of resistance. They sought international recognition for their actions against the EJŻ. The links between the ""Greens Federation"" and activists from Western Europe were most often used. During the Rainbow meeting in 1990, Greenpeace decided to launch a pan-European campaign aimed at putting pressure on the Polish government to give up its plans to build a nuclear power plant. This was done mainly by sending letters to the government on behalf of Western European environmental organizations. The largest demonstrations were organized in France, Spain and Scandinavia. Occupations of embassies and consulates were also organized [8].With time, the authorities realized that there was no point in insisting on building the EJŻ. The team of the President of the National Atomic Energy Agency for the Żarnowiec nuclear power plant issued the following opinion: ""In the current economic situation of the country, the construction of the EJŻ should not be continued."" [6] [13] Therefore, On December 17, the Council of Ministers put the power plant into liquidation (deadline: December 31, 1992) [11] [14]. At that time, the construction of the power plant was very advanced (the first reactor was 98% completed, the second - 80%), and $ 770,000,000 has been spent so far (at 1990 prices) [11]. This decision - with severe economic consequences (the cost of demolition was huge) - was made despite the interest and declarations of support from European companies and institutions (Siemens, EDF, IVO Engineering, Commission of the European Communities) and the US (Westinghouse, US government) [8]. The parliamentary resolution allowed for the construction of new generation nuclear power plants, ensuring economic efficiency and radiological safety. With time, several of already constructed buildings were looted and devastated [7]. Therefore, plans for the development of domestic nuclear energy are revived from time to time. Currently, the Polish nuclear power program (2020 version) provides for the construction and commissioning of 2 nuclear power plants with 3 reactors each. The choice of technology will take place in 2021, and the choice of the location for the first power plant in 2022 (decision: the Choczewo commune near Żarnowiec). Start of construction of the first reactor in 2026, its commissioning in 2033; commissioning of the last reactor in the second power plant in 2043 [15].",zarnowiec-nuclear-power-plant-pomerania-poland,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Amsterdam and Rotterdam are the two largest petroleum and coal harbours of Europe. Coal boats arrive from Colombia, USA, South Africa and Russia with 70% of the coal heading to Germany. Crude oil is imported from Russia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, U.K. and Nigeria, among other places. Via their exports of refined petroleum from the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, companies such as the Dutch Vitol, the largest gasoline trader in the world, are responsible are systematically dumping toxins on West-African countries. Pollutants are wilfully added to gasoline and diesel up to levels that exceed European standards by three hundred times. Combustion of these fuels--commonly referred to by traders as 'African quality'--can lead to severe health problems and even premature death. Local activists say that the Netherlands may have a green reputation for its cycling infrastructure and progressive image, but this is obscuring the country's role in Europe's fossil fuel economy. ""Because of the bicycle lanes, you don't see the coal ports any more."" While Rotterdam can considered the big fish, resistance has focused on Amsterdam so far due to strategic and logistical considerations. This is also where local activists experimented with the first two editions of the Climate Games in 2014 and 2015. As well as a series of occupations and blockades happening, targeting the NUON/Vattenfall coal fired power station in 2015, the coal port in 2016 and in 2017 the 'dirty diesel' terminal owned by Vitol, the largest independent gasoline trader in the world. Amsterdam Fossil Free is also running a campaign since beginning 2015 that includes demands for a fossil fuel free harbour. As a result of this pressure, the broader discussion around the use of coal in the Netherlands, as well as the influence of the Energiewende in Germany, the port of Amsterdam issued a declaration in March 2017 that coal will be phased out from the port by the year 2030. Activists welcomed the mile stone decision as a step in the right direction, while pointing out that much faster action is required to avoid escalating climate change. In 2017, a new and broad coalition of climate activists called 'Code Rood' (Code Red) called for mass civil disobedience against the fossil fuel industry in the port of Amsterdam. A a climate camp was organised from 22 to 26 June and a mass civil disobedience action took place on June 24th. Some 300 people from the Netherlands, supported by groups coming from Belgium, Britain, Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden occupied Europe's second largest coal port, shutting down all operations for one day, making it the largest civil disobedience action in Dutch history.",resistance-against-rotterdam-and-amsterdam-fossil-fuel-ports,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Adani Mining Pty Ltd, an Australian subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited, India, has approval to build the Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Project in the Galilee Basin in Central Queensland, Australia. The thermal coal mine, if completed, will be Australia's largest coal mine, and one of the largest coal mines in the world [1]. It will include open cut and underground coal mining and associated mine processing facilities and produce 60 million tonnes of coal per annum (Mtpa) and 4.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions [1]. The coal will initially be transported via a private rail line connecting the mine to Moranbah. From there it will be transported via the existing public rail line to the coal terminal facilities at the Port of Abbot Point and/or the Port of Hay Point (Dudgeon Point expansion), where it will be exported to India to meet the country's demand for coal. The project is expected to have an operating life of approximately 90 years [2]. The Federal and Queensland state governments support the coal mine on the basis of economic growth and job creation, regardless of the depressed coal market that is seeing declining revenues and coal volumes. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that ""Australia's seaborne thermal coal sector is in serious structural decline. This is not cyclical"" [3]. The proposal has also been approved in the context of global commitments to address climate change. There is strong opposition to the project from environmental groups on the basis of climate change and impacts on the local and regional environment and threatened species and the Great Barrier Reef. The project was initially approved in October 2015, and then delayed due to a successful legal challenge by the Mackay Conservation Group based on protections of the vulnerable Yakka Skink and Ornamental Snake; a challenge from the Land Services of Coast and Country based on impacts on groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems, biodiversity and particularly the Black-throated Finch, contribution to climate change, and that the mine is not viable and contrary to public interest [1]; and the Australian Conservation Foundation regarding the conflict between approving the mine and the Federal government's obligation to protect the Great Barrier Reef [3]. The Wangan and Jagalingou People registered a claim for native title in 2004 and the land within the claim is affected by the proposal. Adani is therefore required to consult with the Wangan and Jagalingou People, however the Wangan and Jagalingou People have rejected the Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) proposed by Adani. The mine has still been approved under the Native Title Act, and the Wangan and Jagalingou People are appealing this in the high court [1]. At this stage, the project is approved and has been deferred until 2017 [4].",carmichael-coal-mine-and-rail-project-queensland-australia,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"The Guaraqueçaba Climate Action Project is a nearly 19,000 hectares forest conservation project in the Brazilian State of Paraná. Initiated by the NGOs The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Sociedade de Pesquisa em Vida Selvagem e Educação Ambiental (SPVS) in 2001, it is one of the world's first forest carbon offset projects. [1] It has been internationally presented as pioneer model for REDD (Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation) to mitigate climate change. It is an attempt to quantify emissions saved by not cutting down forests – implying that these would be otherwise deforested – and selling these as carbon credits, creating economic incentive. [2] [3]The Paraná coastal area is traditionally inhabited by Caiçara, Quilombola and Guarani communities. For centuries the local communities have used the land and the surrounding area for fishing, hunting and small-scale extraction of palmito, vines and wood. [1] [2] In the area, land has been in shared use over generations and communities practiced agricultural activities, sometimes individually, in families, or collectively but in most cases communities never became registered as land owners. They livelihoods were based on the forest and on traditional practices of subsistence farming (of crops such as cassava) which relied on shifting cultivation as well as on hunting and fishing. Thus, communities depend directly on the forest and an harmonious coexistence, having left the area as one of the most well-preserved ones of the Atlantic Forest biome which in other areas has already suffered from high levels of destruction. In the 1960s, the region experienced the arrival of loggers, and in the following, ranchers came who began to register and take over control of the land. A common practice was grilagem, the illegal registration and appropriation of land. Ranchers used jagunços (hired gunmen) to invade the territory and threaten small farmers. Due to the local conditions of deforested land prone to be flooded, they mostly held water buffaloes instead of cattle. [1] [3] [4]First conservation units of today's Guaraqueçaba protection zone were established in the 1980s without public consultation and planning, thus already creating a series of conflicts due to restrictions of access and the loss of commonly shared space. In the 1990s, conservation NGOs such as SPVS arrived in the region with the main interest to conduct conservation studies but without engaging in dialogue with the affected communities. In 1994, SPVS was donated areas within the protection zone and established the conservation unit of Morro da Mina, and in 1999 they acquired further areas forming the units of Serra do Itaqui and Rio Cachoeira. They thus controlled a total of 18,600 hectares of protected land in the municipalities of Guaraqueçaba and Antonina, parts of it were however degraded from grazing. [5] To generate funding for the necessary reforestation and conservation measures, they, together with TNC, initiated the Guaraqueçaba Climate Action Project as a pioneer carbon offset model and in 2001 officially started a cooperation with the three U.S.  companies General Motors, American Electric Power and Chevron. [1] [6] As one of the first actions, SPVS prohibited further farming in the area and the use of the forest through the local community. [7] They removed all buffalo from the area and adopted accounting and monitoring measures. The installing of the forest police known as Força Verde together with the restrictions of usage is perhaps the clearest controversy in this conflict. [1] [3] From official side the projects has been presented as one giving benefits back to the community, providing workshops in skills such as ecology or first aid, employing dozens of people from the region (e.g. as forest rangers) and promoting sustainable business in the area. [7] It is stated that ""The main goals of the project are biodiversity conservation, restoration of degraded pasture, sustainable development of local communities, and generation of carbon offsets that are real, measurable, and verifiable."" [8] At the beginning, 47 people from the local communities (three of them women) were employed as forest rangers and paid slightly more than minimum wage. It was promised that like the project these jobs would last for 40 years. However, the opportunities for income generation were not long-lasting as from the initial employees almost all got fired and other training and skill-building initiatives that were initially provided to the community have gradually dwindled out over the years as the conservation groups ran out of money. A honey production project is the only initiative that was reported to be successfully ongoing, and a ecotourism cooperative has recently started to operate. [1] [9]On the Nature Conservancy's website the project is promoted as an example of corporate partnership that makes an invaluable contribution to protecting biodiversity. [1] However, journalists and environmental justice organizations have documented community voices about experienced negative impacts of the project. Interviews with the affected communities reveal that the idea of carbon trade is not tangible to people, they do not understand why money is paid but does not arrive at the communities. [6] People report that their access to the abundant forest and rivers gradually became restricted, including the prohibition of cutting down trees for self-sustenance, even on community owned land. A community member stated: ""We have always preserved the forest, except that sometimes we need to cut a few trees too, sometimes we need to build a house, we need wood. But it's not allowed, so things are difficult. When the SPVS arrived, it was the end of anything."" [1] Community members also reported that park rangers shot after them when collecting vines. Another local community member reported that Força Verde came into his house several times without authorization, wearing weapons, harassing his family and even confiscating knives. Other reports include the handcuffing of people and a fine following several days of imprisonment for a community member who cut down a tree to build a canoe. [1] [2] [6]While the 55 communities within the Climate Action Project are forced to adopt a way of life that depends more on the generation of economic income, having to buy food instead of collecting or growing it, most of them do not see an increase in income through the project. In fact, the restriction of territory and modes of production and criminalization of their traditional way of life due to the Climate Action Project might partly explain why the region shows the lowest human development indicators in the State of Paraná and one of the lowest in whole Brazil. [5][6] Many residents were left without means of survival and thus men had to look for work outside the area and leave women and children alone in an unsafe state. [1] As a consequence, this has led to profound socio-economic changes. Many families have chosen to move away from the place they have lived for generations. The community became more dependent on wage labor, instead of producing cassava they now have to buy it, and dietary habits have changed. As people moved away, communities became smaller and middle-class families from Curitiba have started to buy up land and houses to spend weekends and holidays. [1] [2][10] Some villages in the interior parts are now almost abandoned as life has become too difficult. A villager reported that his family is the only one left. Many people moved to Antonina, the closest village. They have difficulties to adapt to life in the urban environment, lack skills to find work and generate income, and often live in inhospitable, irregular accommodations. Their situation has increased the number of diseases and a circle of poverty and formerly unknown social problems such as the separation of families, prostitution, drugs or alcoholism. [6]Some local inhabitants have organized to resist the restrictive action of SPVS. In 2003, some local communities, with support of the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), occupied an area of land to prevent its sale to SPVS. This was done in a move to solidarize with posseiros – small landless farmers without official land ownership who had come to occupy abandoned and degraded land but were at the risk of eviction. Until today, 20 families live there in an established camp named Acampamento Agroflorestal José Lutzenberger (the name of an environmentalist) and hope to be able to recognize it as an agrarian reform settlement by the Brazilian government. In 2017, the Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (INCRA) was still in negotiations to buy the land from old owners. The community reported repeated pressure against them as well as the use of toxic agrochemicals by the ranch owners polluting the local river, which was however ignored by the environmental authorities. As an alternative approach, they have carried out small reforestation projects and collective afro-forestry projects, combining organic farming at about 10 percent of the surface with the cultivation of trees which led to the recuperation of formerly abandoned land. Food is sold to nearby schools via a national school nutrition program, but families also cultivate small parcels for their own use. While there are no direct mobilizations against SPVS, communities have received international support with several environmental justice organizations and journalists raising awareness for their struggle and the reported changed living circumstances due to the project, but also against carbon offsetting policies in general as these would just allow corporations to buy credits to make up for their caused environmental damage. In 2017, the community in the José Lutzenberger camp received the Juliana Santilli award and some financial support for their efforts in conservation and sustainable practices of agroecological production (e. g. café, banana, cabbage).

"The project for the construction of the pipeline called ""Adriatica Network"" was proposed in 2005 by the company SNAM Rete Gas with the aim of strengthening the national methane transportation network [1]. According to the non-technical summary of the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), the SPA Company of Brindisi LNG, owner of the Regasifier of Brindisi, had requested from SNAM the availability of new entry capacities to the network at the Brindisi Terminal. To meet this request, SNAM presented a new project that included the construction of a 687 km long Methanedax, from Massafra (TA) to Minerbio (BO), passing through 10 regions, and a central ""compression and thrust"" in Sulmona (AQ) [1]. In particular, the new pipeline would have been connected to the existing Bernarda - Brindisi Methanadox (in Massafra) and, to the north, to the existing TransMed methane pipelines [1]. The project, to be evaluated and approved, was divided into 5 sections for which five different environmental impact assessments were requested [1]. All the features of the Adriatic network obtained positive environmental impact assessment decrees, issued in agreement between the Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea and the Ministry of Heritage and Activities [1] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [2] [3] [4]. As mentioned, the project also includes the construction of a compression center in Sulmona, in a first instance seismic area [5] near the false of Mount Morrone. Its environmental impact assessment was granted by the Ministry of the Environment on March 7, 2011 [6]. The initial project, as the name suggested, was expected along the Adriatic coast, but due to the high degree of urbanization, the central section of the route was moved to the Apennine mountains, in areas with high seismic risk. The structure would pass through areas with high naturalistic value for biodiversity, in particular 3 national parks, 1 Regional Natural Park, and 21 sites of community importance [7]. Thousands of inhabitants and their land risk are involved in the expropriation procedures and subject to heavy passage. Since 2005, mobilizations against the project in Marche and Umbria have begun, highly seismic areas affected in the past by earthquakes where populations oppose the realization of a potentially risky project. Subsequently, the mobilizations expanded to other regions, focusing on the areas where the project presents the most critical issues: Abruzzo, Marche, and Umbria. Many local agencies (municipalities and provinces), along with associations and committees, have submitted appeals for national and community legal procedures. In Abruzzo, thousands of citizens from the Peligna Valley, gathered in the city committees for the environment of Sulmona, participated in a large demonstration in Sulmona in March 2010. In September 2010, the interregional anti-Pipeline coordination ""No Tube"" was born, with local authorities, associations, and committees joining. The coordination requested the establishment of a national table for technical comparison. The main reasons for opposition to the project are the location of the track in very high seismic risk areas; The large impact that, in many features, the methane pipeline has on the natural environment, in areas of historical and archaeological interest and in the economic activities of the populations; The risks deriving from possible accidents or explosions (such as on 07/03/2015 in Pineto in Teramo caused by a landslide). Additionally, the committees and associations opposed to the project complain that this is a job for commercial purposes without any advantage for the populations residing in the pipeline passage areas. The gas imported from abroad, through the TAP (Trans Adriatic Pipeline) from Azerbaijan or other international pipelines, is mainly intended to be resold to other European countries (Italy would become a gas center). Another criticism refers to the lack of a single procedure for the entire project turning recommendations from community institutions for large works and lack of transparency in the authorization procedures and options operated until now. These reasons led the citizens to request the opening of a negotiating table with designers, local institutions, civil protection, partial experts, and interested populations to identify alternatives to the current project. The local administrations of the regions involved showed a different stance on the project: the position of Abruzzo was one of the most difficult. The Parco Region has resolved against the project with three laws: 28 of 19/19/2012 [8], 14 of 07/06/2013 [9] declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court through judgment 119 of 2014 [10] and 13 of 8/06/ 2015 [11] declared unconstitutional through judgment No. 249 of 2016 [12]. In 2010, the EC Community use of the Provinces of L'Aquila, Pesaro, and Perugia, of the municipalities of Castello and Gubbio and the Mountain Cathed and the community of Nero [7] began. Also thanks to the pressure from the protest movement, the Environmental Commission of the Chamber of Deputies approved a resolution on 26/10/2011 that ""commits"" the government to organize the modification of the methane pipeline track through a special technical table of experts [13]. Furthermore, between 2011 and 2013, the Abruzzo region approved three different resolutions to reiterate the opposition's position (18.10.2011, 14.02.2012, and 3.12.2013) [14] and in 2014 through D.G.R. north. 500 of July 29, 2014, the region specifically rejected the integrated environmental authorization measure (AIA PROVISION NO. 235/86 of 22.2.2013), necessary authorization for SNAM to proceed [14]. On October 1, 2014, MISE convened the so-called working table at the end of which there were no advances: no proposals were implemented by SNAM on alternative routes [14]. The same fate also for the Services Conference in February 2015 which has not recorded any steps forward, with SNAM not available to consider the other proposed tracks [15]. The conflict has sharply returned in late 2017. By resolution of December 22, 2017, of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and through the Final Authorization Decree issued in March 2018, the central government, ignoring popular will, authorized the construction and operation of the compression and thrust control unit in Sulmona [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]. For this reason, 23 mayors, including Mayor Sulmona, went to Montecitorio to express their opposition, ready to resign from the tricolor band [27]. Not only the local administrations raised the issue: in February 2018, a coordination called Hub of Gas: Abruzzo was born, and after the organization of a caravan, no Snam, I was the purpose of traveling through the territories threatened by methane to provide information and awareness, On April 21, 2018, a demonstration was called in Sulmona, to which more than 240 associations, committees, and territorial realities were summoned [28]. In fact, regarding the event called after the accelerated Government in the Sulmona plant, the Committee tries to shed light even on a general problem that Italy is transforming into a gas HUB visa the different projects that are developing in this period and given the will of the manifesto of the state to focus on gas in the field of energy (see Sen 2017) [29].",gasdotto-rete-adriatica-brindisi-minerbio-e-centrale-di-compressione-di-sulmona,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA

"Tanzania and Uganda signed a $3.5 billion deal to build an oil pipeline on September 13 – sparking a wave of outcry from environmental groups. There are basically two projects: to exploit oil around Lake Albert in Uganda (419 wells, 1.7 bilion barrels) in a new oil extraction frontier, and to ship it through a 1,445 km pipeline to the coast in Tanzania. (6). The frontier of oil extraction continues to advance, because energy cannot be recycled. The energy in the fossil fuels is burnt for ever, therefore new supplies are required although  oil prices collapsed in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis and there are long-term concerns about climate change.  In Uganda, French supermajor Total, China's CNOOC and flagging British firm Tullow Oil team up to plan a 1,445 km pipeline transporting oil from Uganda to Tanzania. It  will connect oil fields in Uganda's Lake  Albert region to the port of Tanga on Tanzania's Indian Ocean coastline, near the Kenyan border. Work on the pipeline will begin by 2020, and it is expected to carry nearly 200,000 barrels of oil per day, 10 million tons per year. In September 2020 Tanzanian President John Magufuli signed the deal with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni.[1].There will be impacts o the local ecosystems and local people's lives. Human rights group FIDH and NGO Oxfam  published on September 10, 2020, two reports expressed concern over the project.(7).  ""Estimates suggest that at least 12,000 families will lose part or all of their land thanks to this project,"" Sacha Feierabend, a globalisation and human rights consultant at FIDH, told FRANCE 24. ""Companies go door-to-door and buy land, promising to resettle the inhabitants in new villages with new land,"" she continued. However, such ""compensation"" looks unlikely to satisfy the local inhabitants. The pipeline plans ""don't take their customs into consideration"", Feierabend said. ""For example, in some Ugandan villages where families have already been resettled, clans have been mixed and are now living on top of each other. Meanwhile certain crucial components of the common good, such as wells and pasture land shared with neighbours, cannot be moved."" [1]. [2]. Another concern is that air and water quality could be threatened. ""Oil exploration activities carried out a few years ago in Uganda have already made access to safe drinking water more complicated, Feierabend noted. ""There is no reason why it should be any different today; a leak could have disastrous consequences on the lakes and rivers in the local area,"" she continued. The threat is all the more serious as the project envisages 419 oil wells being drilled near Lake Albert, one of Africa's largest lakes. ""This is an exceptional ecosystem, which allows thousands of fishermen to live off its resources, so it is crucial to prevent drilling in these protected areas,"" Feierabend said.Although the project looks set to go ahead, as things stand, Total will have to defend its role before the France's Court of Appeal on October 28. NGO Survie, the French branch of Friends of the Earth and Ugandan associations Afigeo, Cred, Nape and Navoda have filed a complaint against the French supermajor. In particular, they accuse Total of breaking the law by expropriating land before compensating itsinhabitants.[1] [2]UPDATE 23/11/2022The organisations resisting the pipeline have united their efforts in the STOP EACOP International Alliance [8]. Besides the legal challenge to the project, they have also adopted a financial activism approach in calling for banks to withhold funding and insurers to not cover for EACOP [9]. This move has brought protests around the world to global financial centers like London, New York and Paris, and has put under the spotlight the actors that benefit and are necessary to sustain large oil and gas infrastructure like EACOP [10].The European Parliament has also been effectively lobbied by activist and it has produced a statement against the infrastruture [11].In October 2021, six members of the local organisation Afiego were detained by Ugandan police. They were allegedly held for breaching the NGO Act and operating without a permit. However, Nicholas Bariyo, an Afiego board member said ""there is a coordinated effort to silence critical voices that speak out against the destruction of the environment and the abuse of oil project-affected communities' rights."" [12].In October 2022, nine university students were arrested in Kampala for expressing their support to the EU Parliament resolution against EACOP [13].

"The Irrawaddy river, locally known in Myanmar as the Ayeyarwady, is often described as Myanmar's backbone. It originates in the northern region of Kachin and flows through the central area splitting the country into two parts, until it empties through the Irrawaddy Delta into the Indian Ocean. It is the country's largest river and the most important commercial waterway.Traditionally, the Irrawaddy river has been central to Myanmar's economy. After the political and economic opening of the country started in 2011, the Irrawaddy has gained new investment interest. Nevertheless, the management of the river is still far from being systematized and comprehensive. In December 2014, the World Bank approved a USD100 million loan to implement a research and development program for the Irrawaddy basin under the name of Ayeyawaddy Integrated River Basin Management (AIRBM) [1].The program aims at collecting information about the Irrawaddy for future development. Thus, according to the Myanmar Times, the government has pledged that ""natural resource conservation together with development, priority areas for investment, environmental impact assessment, social impact assessment and opinions of the residents will be taken into account [2]"".While NGOs recognize the importance of having enough data for a better management of the river [3], environmental groups have raised concerns about the use that will be given to the data collected and the impacts of the new activities on the river [4]. The government has already started implementing a 'Navigation Enhancement Plan' from Mandalay to Nyaung-U [5] that will feature navigation enhancements and that will include the construction of retaining walls and concrete barriers for the riverbed and digging sandbanks, among others. The data might also be used for the development of hydropower projects, mainly in the upper part of the river, and for the development of other controversial projects, such as the Amarapura Urban Development Project. Environmentalists have also rejected the designation of the Irrawaddy River as an ""international river,"", included in the project, saying the trans-border status could invite undue influence on the river by neighboring countries [6].

"The MRL Agata Nickel Mining project will expand, with a permit to expand to what it calls the Tapian Extension (which has an Exploration Permit for 6,842.28 hectares). This EP overlaps with the Mamanwa ancestral domain claim that has a total area of 8,000 hectares. (http://www.mindoro.com/s/AgataOverview.asp) Chronological events with regard to the expansion in Jabonga are as follows: May 11, 1999: MRL received certification to begin exploration in work in Agata, Santiago, Agusan del Norte, from the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). June 17, 1999: Department of Environment and Natural Resources issued Exploration Permit. June 23, 1999: The MRL team began the ""early stage of exploration"". **The May 11 certification of Raiz read that, based on ""field investigation and verification conducted by the NCIP within the areas covered by MPSA XIII-07,"" there are ""no indigenous peoples living within the subject areas, nor are there any existing applications for certificate of ancestral domain claim or certificate of ancestral land title."" (Reference: http://gina.ph/CyberDyaryo/features/cd1999_0708_003.htm). To date, the Mamanwa communities have not been properly consulted about the project.

In its Scoping Study in 2010, MRL indicated the communities that will be affected by the project include Mamanwa and Manobo communities and fisherfolks and farmers. It said it will impact Lake Mainit and effect development, environmental and social impacts such as: a. Erosion and rehabilitation of drill sites and trenches; b. Waste material; c. Water and effluent management; d. Consultation of communities/FPIC; and e. Compensation and management of local expectations of IP communities. For the Mamanwas, a major concern is the displacement of indigenous communities and their culture, and the lack of consultation (including general public) about the mining project.

"Wilmington, California is home to the third most productive oil area in the US, the Wilmington Oil Field, which contains over 3,400 wells [6]. Warren Resources opened its first oil drilling facility in the neighborhood in 1999. Warren Resources is a privately owned company that currently owns 2 facilities, the Wilmington Townlot Unit (WTU) Central Facility at 625 E Anaheim Street and the North Wilmington Unit (NWU) Central Facility at 2209 E I Street [9]. They have come under fire recently for operating under expired permits, failing to conduct proper environmental reviews, and disregarding public health [3]. Also under suspicion is the California Geologic Energy Management Division, or CalGEM, who granted Warren Resources permits to drill despite their expired city approval [3]. In 2019, CalGEM came under attack for giving permits for Warren to drill for oil with this expired documentation as well as without properly analyzing the possible negative effects of the projects. Residents have raised questions on why CalGEM would grant Warren these permits, or if they are valid due to the expired documents [2]. CalGEM has since developed a new policy that includes training for racial justice issues and explicitly states their expectations for public health for new projects [6].Some of the chemicals present in the pollution from Warren Resources are benzene, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These chemicals are known carcinogens, and VOCs can cause a multitude of health effects, such as asthma, irritation of the nose and eyes, and kidney and liver damage [1]. Since the facilities are located very close to residential areas and local parks, many of these chemicals affect the residents of Wilmington. Children especially feel these effects, growing up with constant bloody noses, headaches, and asthma [2]. Residents have complained about these side effects for years, yet nothing has been done to alleviate the amount of pollution. In the 4% of schools in California located near oil or gas wells, 70% of the students are Black or Hispanic [6]. Wilmington is no exception, with a high school and middle school being within a mile of the drilling facility. These children are constantly exposed to these toxic chemicals, and since children are often more susceptible to lung problems, this does all the more damage. Studies have shown that living close to these facilities increases risks for impaired lung functions, reproductive issues, cancer, and heart disease [6].The air pollution in Wilmington, especially since the area is urban, largely affects human health over the environment. However, methane causes smog, which not only damages the lungs but is a large contributor to climate change due to its great global heating potential [1]. Climate change disproportionally affects people of color and marginalized communities, such as Wilmington. The effects of climate change largely affect lower-income communities as well, so Wilmington is at a higher risk. Oil drilling also creates problems of noise pollution and tremors from drills, which residents have reported have gotten so violent that they have shattered the windows of their homes [2]. The drilling facilities also cause pollution in the water, so residents are advised not to drink tap water without some sort of water purifier [6].The community has been fighting Warren Resources for many years with the help of local environmental justice organizations. Notably, Communities for a Better Environment, a non-profit organization established in 1971 spanning multiple states, held a press conference on June 2, 2022, that aimed to outline the violations of Warren Resources and hold them accountable for their damage to the community [8]. Speakers included U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, who joined in with the residents to criticize Warren Resources and demand accountability from the company [5]. She argued that the community has sued the company and there are laws in place that should protect them, but that the only way to be actually safe is to stop oil drilling completely [8]. Stand Together Against Neighborhood Drilling, or STAND-LA, was also at this protest and is working together with residents to expose Warren and make sure the city knows that they are fighting for their right to a non-polluted neighborhood [8]. They are asking for legislation to be put into place to protect them, either for shutting down the plant entirely, asking for compensation, or setting stricter regulations on air pollution from oil drilling. Wilmington residents, over 90% of whom are Latinx [9], have been complaining about oil drilling near their homes for over 20 years, yet very little has changed. This population is not only exposed to dangerous air pollution, with facilities pumping toxic chemicals into the air every day, but they receive no benefit from the drilling as a community. The area is also low-income, with many households making under $20,000 a year [9]. This means that many of the residents are not able to move out of the area due to financial instability. Legislation has passed that addresses some concerns. For example, SB-1137 is a bill that requires a 3,200-foot buffer between residential areas and oil wells. The bill states that Black and Hispanic communities are more heavily affected by oil drilling, and assistance should be provided to communities previously affected. The bill was approved on September 16, 2022, and is set to go into action in January 2025 [4]. Warren Resources has not put out any statement on what they will do to follow this buffer requirement, as their main drilling facility is located directly in the middle of residential and recreational spaces. They also have not addressed whether or not they will be compensating the residents of Wilmington who were affected by this facility. The city also plans to phase out oil drilling in this area completely, but for now, regulations for buffer zones help to alleviate some of the stress on the local community [5]. Different counties have different setback rules, but CalGEM put out a paper on Statutes and Regulations in January 2022 that would aim to regulate the entire state. It outlines many ideas on zoning, public health, hazardous waste, and public lands [7]. Statewide regulation would limit the power of oil companies and hold them accountable for any damage they may cause to the environment and public health.Even though they had some press during the start of their protests, nothing has truly changed in Wilmington. There are promises to stop oil drilling and create buffer zones, but it will be years until those actions go into full effect [4]. The Warren Resources facility is still operational, and they have not said anything about their involvement in air pollution in the community. The community needs more than the promise of regulation two years into the future [5]. Even public hearings, such as one to determine the response to the permits given to Warren on expired paperwork, have been discussed but never scheduled [2].",oil-drilling-in-wilmington-ca,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"(based on David Pellow ́s book Resisting Global Toxics) In 1978,  Owens-Illinois Corporation, a United States ́s company,   sold all of its property and assets in one Bahamian island, Abaco, to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Until that time, the company had been the largest Abaco employer. Owens-Illinois owned and operated a sugar mill and plantation that, upon its exit, left a dearth of jobs in its wake. Abaco's economy and employment rate were harmed for many years afterward. Compounding these economic concerns were environmental threats no one anticipated. Left behind on the property were ""more than 40 fifty-gallon drums of pesticides"" as well as ""the herbicide mixture of 2,4–D and 2,4,5–T, also known as Agent Orange."" Although the sugar mill was not located directly near a large population, it was above the water table that served as the main drinking source for most of the island's residents. A number of the drums were corroded and leaking chemicals into the ground, causing great concern among the island's citizenry when they discovered these materials years after Owens-Illinois departed. According to the Bahamian Ministry of Health, the chemicals have been stored at the site since 1970. Tests done by laboratories in 1989, confirmed the presence of very hazardous substances such as dioxin (one of the most toxic substances known to science).In 1991, reEarth, a Bahamian environmental organization and other concerned citizens approached the Bahamian government to request that the site is cleaned up. However, when the company sold the farm, the legal framework that would impose responsibility for any toxic waste left behind was not in place. After two years of struggle by both local citizens, reEarth and other supporters such as Greenpeace and Global Responsibility and key dialogue efforts in 1995, The Bahamas government declared that  ""working jointly with Owens-Illinois has had all the hazardous waste disposed of from the sugar mill site"" and they had contracted a firm to remove the waste at the cost of $370,000. The company opened all the old drums and repacked the most hazardous wastes in special drums which were shipped to Finland for disposal.

"In 2005, the National Environmental Authority (ANAM) granted permits to AES-Panama and AES-Changuinola (subsidiaries of Allied Energy Systems Corporation) for the construction of the Changuinola I Hydroelectric Project (Chan-75 or Gavilán). This project is located in the Changuinola-Teribe River basin, Palo Seco protective forest, buffer zone of La Amistad National Park (shared with Costa Rica), a World Heritage Site since 1983, and where Ngabe Buglé indigenous people live. During 2006 and 2007, according to Cultural Survival organization, AES conducted a flawed consultation process, consisting solely of ""explaining the economic benefits that the dam would bring and the nature of the lands where the Ngöbe were to be resettled."" Upon rejecting the resettlement, AES began to pressure the inhabitants to leave the area to be flooded through threats and repression. In 2007, Ngabe indigenous people filed a writ of amparo with the Supreme Court of Justice which did not succeed. Simultaneously, demonstrations and public campaigns were carried out, with the most significant being on January 3, 2008, when a demonstration ended in clashes with the national police, physical violence against indigenous people, and the arrest of 54 individuals, including minors. In 2008, with the hydroelectric plant under construction, Cultural Survival (CS) and the Alliance for Conservation and Development (ACD) filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) for the destruction of forests, forced displacements, threats to environmentalists, and psychological mistreatment. The clearest example was experienced by Isabel Becker when, in 2007, AES members forced her to sign a document with her fingerprint (as she couldn't read or write) relinquishing her land rights to the company, leading to her eviction a few days later. As a result of the complaint, in 2009, the IACHR requested the suspension of the project. That same year, the conflict prompted a visit from the UN Special Rapporteur, who also concluded a violation of indigenous rights and recommended a review of the project. Disregarding these recommendations, in 2011, the area was flooded, displacing 1,500 indigenous people, to whom compensation was promised but has not yet materialized. Since 2012, a group called ""Affected by Changuinola I"" has been advocating before Panamanian public institutions to compel AES to fulfill the promised payment for their lands.

"When Typhoon Yolanda, also known as Haiyan, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, hit Southeast Asia in November 2013, the Philippines was particular badly affected. The island of Sicogon was left in a dire state; the homes, livelihoods and fishing craft of 6,000 residents were devastated. Five months later members of the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk (FESIFFA), along with the Save Agrarian Reform Alliance (SARA) network of national farmers' organizations and non-government organizations, reported that not a single government agency had assisted residents in their efforts to reconstruct their homes and rebuild their lives.[1] International  organizations, such as ICCO Cooperation, a Netherlands based NGO, provided support for FESIFFA members' attempts to rebuild their livelihoods.[2]The government's post-typhoon no dwelling/no build zone policy exacerbated Sicogon residents' continued lack of shelter. Prohibiting building homes within 40 meters of the coastline, where many poor, rural families built their homes in order to be near to their sources of livelihood, the policy had effectively rendered more than 1,000 families homeless. Deprived of options for rebuilding their homes and communities, more than 200 Sicogon families occupied a portion of publicly owned forest land, without support or approval from authorities. Sicogon Island Development Corporation (SIDECO), aided by allied officials in the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), threatened to file cases against FESIFFA farmers for their occupation of the forest lands.[1]SIDECO had long laid claim to Sicogon; the family that owns the corporation said that it purchased 809 hectares, about 70 per cent of the 1,160 hectare island, in 1972.[3] SIDECO seized on the opportunity to begin developing the island as a tourism destination, entering into a joint venture partnership with real estate firm Ayala Land, which had already expressed an interest in expanding its tourism portfolio, to undertake a 'Sicogon Island Redevelopment Project'. It soon became evident that the project was geared to pushing the tourism venture rather than rehabilitating residents. A SARA spokesperson said: ""The residents affected by SIDECO's plans for a tourism resort have ample legal documents to prove they are agrarian reform beneficiaries. This is a clear incident of land-grabbing facilitated by both natural disasters and government's lack of political will.""Failure to protect land rightsIn addition to failing to help islanders rehabilitate, the government failed to protect their land rights. FESIFFA president Paul Ramos said that land-grabbers had exploited post-disaster chaos and confusion, preventing people from returning to lands they had resided upon for decades. After Typhoon Yolanda struck SIDECO's private security guards forcibly prevented families from rebuilding or even repairing their houses. FESIFFA stated that SIDECO had prohibited the island's residents from reconstruction of their homes.[1] The National Secretariat for Social Action (NASSA), the social service arm of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, attempted to provide temporary shelter to Yolanda victims, providing affected communities with shelter materials. Executive secretary Fr. Edu Gariguez said that SIDECO officials blocked their efforts at assistance, harassing NASSA staff and threatening to demolish the houses. Corporations were using the government's  rehabilitation programme for their own benefit.[4]Instead of rehabilitating residents in their places of origin SIDECO offered residents two options: a payment of PhP 150,000 (USD 3,378) per family to vacate the island or a relocation site in Barangay Jolog, on the neighbouring island of Panay. FESIFFA reported that, by April 2014, most of the families who had taken up either of these options were attempting to return to Sicogon, due to relocation homes being of substandard quality and lack of availability of  resettlement sites.[1]A compromise agreementA 2016 report by FIAN to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights CESCR) explains that, according to Commission on Human Rights investigator Leo Salpana, SIDECO's offer, of either payment to leave the island or relocation in Barangay Jolog, was ""not appropriate"" because there was no free, prior and informed consent from affected people, whose problems were compounded by threats by the company and DENR officials to file cases against FESIFFA members for occupying forest lands. SIDECO's offer was followed by a compromise agreement with FESIFFA, brokered by the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC), under which the joint venture would build resettlement sites and provide livelihood and training projects that would bring residents opportunities in tourism schemes. In exchange, 784 families belonging to FESIFFA dropped claims to 334 hectares of land laid claim to by SIDECO, land that they had been seeking to acquire under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Conversion of this 334 hectare area from agricultural to commercial or tourism use, without provisions for issues such as compensation for victims of human rights abuses perpetrated by armed SIDECO security guards and signed by the president of FESIFFA under pressure and in the absence of a special power of attorney from the organization's members, was approved by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) on 3rd March 2016. Change of land use paved the way for the SIDECO / Ayala Land joint venture to fully implement its tourism project.[3]A June 2017 article by Focus on the Global South on the situation of farmers and fisherfolk after Typhoon Yolanda reported that land reforms specified in the compromise agreement that would have benefited farmers had not yet been implemented. Months after their camp out in the forest area threats aimed at forcing them to leave Sicogon – orders to vacate, prohibition on rebuilding and legal cases against forest occupation – continued. But the story was not one of defeat. Many farmers and fishers remained on the island and persisted in their efforts to rebuild their livelihoods. The compromise agreement had caused divisions in FESIFFA but the organization resumed its land rights advocacy work. In April 2017 leaders organized a camp-out and protest in front of the DENR offices in Manila.[2]Violations of obligations under the Right to Food and Nutrition Some Sicogon residents suffered hunger in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda. The FIAN report documents the failure of the Philippine government to fulfil its human rights obligations, under international law, to mitigate and alleviate hunger, even in times of natural or other disasters. Government failure to provide immediate and sustained aid to Yolanda victims, and to protect them from displacement, violated its obligations under the Right to Food and Nutrition (RTFN). In addition, Guideline 16 of the FAO Voluntary Guidelines supporting the right to adequate food, which states that governments should provide food assistance to people in in need in the case of natural disasters, was flouted. FIAN also identified threatening residents who sought refuge in forest land with legal action and conversion of 334 hectares of land from agricultural to commercial/tourism use as clear breaches of obligations under the RTFN to protect legitimate tenure rights of affected persons during post-disaster reconstruction.[3] Disaster capitalismIn an interview with Al Jazeera in August 2018 village chief Wenefred Gonzales spoke of post-Yolanda hunger in Sicogon. He said SIDECO and Ayala abused their positions as reconstruction partners, giving residents meagre food rations to force them to vacate: ""They tried to starve us into taking one of their options. Their goal was to make the people lose hope from the hunger, so that we will have no choice but to leave the island."" Hotels and an airport were under construction on Sicogon and some residents still battling against eviction from the island. Gonzales disagreed with the companies' claims of creating job opportunities: ""What happened on Sicogon is disaster capitalism...They took advantage of the situation after the tragedy and left people with nothing.""[5] In an early report of worsening land disputes in Sicogon, villagers claimed that they were hungry and being threatened, and that release of relief goods was ""conditional"". One villager said that families would not receive a pack of relief goods containing rice, sardines and noodles unless they signed a paper saying they would leave the island.[6] A storm survivor who had worked as a security guard for SIDECO and Ayala spoke of personal experience of the two firms preventing residents from rebuilding their homes. He said that the companies instructed boat owners and village chiefs that construction materials were banned on the island and that he was ordered to stop supplies from reaching residents. He claimed to have witnessed guards intimidating and harassing storm survivors who refused to sign agreements to hand over their land, destroying houses, ordering people to leave and even firing a gun next to a pregnant woman. A researcher at IBON, a local NGO monitoring rebuilding in disaster zones, said the government helped companies take advantage of areas affected by the disaster: ""Tyhoon Haiyan was actually the beginning of a very, very bad reconstruction programme...Here comes a corporation that is interested not in your rehabilitation, but in a lot of things your trauma can offer.""[5]  FESIFFA, Rural Poor Institute of Land and Human Rights Services, Inc. (RIGHTS) and Focus on the Global South established the Behind the Beauty: Sicogon Exposed campaign to push the Philippine Government to take action to resolve agrarian reform and human rights issues on the island, with hundreds of local farmers and forest dwellers displaced to make way for beach resorts and other tourism infrastructure. In August 2018, when the first plane landed at the newly constructed Sicogon Airport, Sicogon Exposed pointed out that the facility sites on 22 hectares of public land, with government agencies such as DENR remaining 'blind and mute' to these developments that leave people with 'less and less land to set foot on'. In March 2019 simultaneous with actions around the country, FESIFFA held actions at Sicogon Airport, the beach and in front of tourism resorts, protesting corporate greed in establishing resorts for the wealthiest 1% while evicting thousands of poor families from the land and fishing grounds they depend upon for their livelihoods.[7] The campaign launched a petition: Stop Ayala's monster tourism on Sicogon Island![8] Cease-and-Desist Order stalls development FESIFFA filed a petition for revocation of the land conversion order on 4th August 2017. The petition stated that SIDECO and Ayala had failed to comply with the terms of the compromise agreement, including providing relocation site, housing and livelihoods. One year and seven months later DAR took action, ordering Ayala Land Inc. and private landowners of high-end resorts on Sicogon Island to stop development activities in a disputed parcel of land. A seven-page Cease-and-Desist Order (CDO) dated 6th March 2019 ordered Ayala, SIDECO and persons acting on their behalf to refrain from continuing with construction activities until a petition for revocation of conversion was resolved or acted upon. The CDO covered 333.4 hectares of land, nearly a third of the island. Besides construction of structures the CDO prohibited ground preparation: preparatory works such as testing, measuring, surveying and earth-moving. The two resorts operating on the island were not covered by the CDO but were temporarily closed. Several residents held protest actions at the offices of DAR and DENR.[9]",sicogon-island-tourism-estate-philippines,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The small Yorkshire village of Kirby Misperton has become a fracking front line, with ongoing protests since Third Energy were granted planning permission to carry out hydraulic fracturing tests. If the tests are successful, this will be the first well in the country to go into production, and could set precedent for many more fracking wells to be built across the region and the rest country in the coming years.  After submitting applications in 2012, Third Energy were given local planning permission in 2016 and began preparatory work for fracking at the site near Kirby Misperton in 2017. The company is extending the Ryedale conventional field, using the existing Kirby Misperton Deep (KM8) well to see if gas can be made to flow by fracking tight sandstone layers of Bowland Shale, which runs across the north of England, at a depth of up to 10,000 feet [1] [2]. Fracking involves directing a high pressure fracking fluid of water, sand and chemicals at the rock to force out gas.  Third Energy's application to frack at Kirby Misperton received 4,275 objections and only 36 letters in favour. The application was also opposed by Ryedale District Council, all five town councils in Ryedale, every Parish Council near the well-site, The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, the Howard Estate and Flamingo Land, Ryedale's flagship tourist attraction only 1 mile from the well-site [3].  Since starting work the company has experienced a number of setbacks including persistent protests, and is still awaiting final approval from the UK government who are requiring the company to complete financial checks [4]. A ban on fracking in Scotland declared in 2017 accompanied by a decline in public support of the extractive method [5].   Since fracking preparations began in May 2017, there has been an ongoing blockade with caravans and tents at the site by local and national activists, where peaceful protests, slow walking, lock ons and lorry surfing have prevented vehicles entering the site. The police have had a heavy presence, arresting activists and costing over £560,000 in public spending as of December 2017 [6]. Protestors are supported with refreshments thanks to the renowned ""anti-fracking tea lady"" despite police intimidation [7], and activists have constructed the Kirby Misperton Community Protection Camp [8], where food and items are donated by the community. There have also been nationwide campaigns, petitions and street protests supported by environmental groups nationwide to encourage Barclays, who own Third Energy, to ""Stop Backing Fracking"" [9].  According to local group Frack Free Ryedale, ""thousands of residents and friends of Ryedale continue to fight against the industrialisation of the North Yorkshire countryside by the fracking industry, which threatens our way of life, our health, our countryside, our water, our wildlife, our farming and our tourism industry"". People who live near fracking wells are deeply concerned about the impact of fracking on their health and well-being, with a likely increase in air pollution, thousands of HGV movements per production well, possible chemical spills and threats to water courses. Others point out that fracking will tie the UK into a new fossil fuel industry for decades to come, at a time when we need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions to slow climate change, and make the transition to green energy and a low-carbon economy [3].",exploratory-fracking-at-kirby-misperton-yorkshire,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"These are Japanese-owned and also Filipino owned nickel and cobalt mining and processing plants in Palawan very possibly causing grave danger to human health and irreversible damage to biodiversity. Rio Tuba is designed to produce 10,000 dry metric tons of nickel to be recovered per year from low grade ore coming from Rio Tuba's open pit mining activity. Its nickel output will be exported to Japan. However, a massive amount of sulfuric acid, a highly toxic chemical used to produce nickel and other toxic chemical substances will be imported from Japan at the rate of 270,000 metric tons annually or 5.4 million metric tons in 20 years. In Coral Bay (the sister factory) imports of sulphuric acid were estimated at 600,000 tons in 2014. Coral Bay operated in 2007 at a capacity of 24,000 tonnes of contained nickel and 1,500 tonnes of contained cobalt per year in the form of a mixed nickel-cobalt sulphide containing approximately 57% nickel and 4% cobalt, which is sold exclusively to Sumitomo for refining at its Nihama Nickel Refinery. The plant applies the high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) process under license from SMM. The process uses sulphuric acid in high temperature, high-pressure autoclave vessels to leach nickel and cobalt from low-grade lateritic nickel ore. In the  HPAL process,  limonite ore is processed into a mixed nickel-cobalt sulphide. Apart from chemical risks to health, the large open pit nickel mines are wiping out old growth forests, precious and endangered plants and animals.The Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation, a firm that have been operating on the island since almost thirty years, became the centre of major controversy in 2002. After a contentious past regarding its poor environmental performance, the company was granted in July 2002 an Environmental Compliance Certificate to expand its mining activities. The legal battle among representatives of the firm and NGOs, which were actively advocating the interests of the native population,  finally resulted in a rally, attracting around 1000 demonstrators of the municipality Bataraza. This social dissatisfaction is not only as a result of the expectations of the native population being let down in the past by the company, especially those of the south-palawenos and some well-informed urban residents, but is also directed towards the environmental bureaucracies, even to the level of the central government. (Alexander Perez Carmona, 2005) (3).In 2009 it was reported  by the CBCD/ALDAW mission that the continuation of mining activities in Bulanjao mountain will irremediably damage the best conserved forest in the southern tip of Palawan, with predictable adverse consequences for the food production capacity of both indigenous Palawan and migrant farmers communities living at the foot of this mountain range. Because of mining activities taking place at high elevations, the risk of landslides is likely to increase to an unprecedented level. Also the eco-tourism potential of this mountain forest is likely to be jeopardized. Furthermore, some of the areas - around and inside the Bulanjao range include sacred and worship sites that are regarded by the local indigenous people as physical evidence of mythological events and are associated with important cosmological principles. The local inhabitants perceive the destruction of these historical and natural landmarks as an obliteration of their history and collective memories of the past. It was recommended that RTNMC (Rio Tuba) and CBNC (Coral Bay) should cease all mining related activities in Bulanjao. They should further comply with the provisions of the Mining Code, which ban mining development from key environmental zones and ancestral lands of indigenous peoples, and with the main tenets of the IPRA law (Indigenous Peoples Rights Act). They should rehabilitate with endemic species all damaged and eroded sites found in the Bulanjao range. (1)In 2012, it was reported that according to the Friends of the Earth Japan (FoE-Japan) and the Kalikasan People's Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE), nickel mining operations in Palawan Island is to blame for the contamination of the Palawan river system. They said the river is already poisoned with unsafe levels of carcinogenic or cancer-causing chemicals. During a press conference in Quezon City, the groups presented findings from an environmental field  study conducted  downstream near the Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation's (RTNMC) mining operations and the Coral Bay Nickel Processing Plant's operation.(5) The study, which started in 2009, analyzed water samples and revealed that present levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr-VI), a toxic and carcinogenic chemical, had already exceeded safe levels in the Togupon River. A researcher from FoE-Japan Hozue Hatae said the water contamination originated either from upstream mining or refinery operations. Togupon River runs through the area where the nickel mining operations of RTNMC and the nickel processing facility of Coral Bay Nickel Corp. (CBNC) are located. Both projects are financed and pursued in partnership with Japanese multinational corporations and institutions, such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance.In August 15, 2015 it was reported that the plan to expand operations in untouched virgin forest areas of southern Palawan has sparked a heated exchange in Puerto Princesa between local officials, led by Governor Jose Chavez Alvarez, and environmental groups opposed to mining in the province. Alvarez, who was presiding over a meeting on Thursday of the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD) to discuss the proposed expansion of Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corp. into Mount Bolanjao in Bataraza, objected to a position paper submitted by environmental group Palawan NGO Network Inc. (PNNI) and challenged its head, lawyer Robert Chan, to a fistfight. Chan, executive director of PNNI, had written the PCSD objecting to the reclassification of areas covered by the mining expansion plan. The letter, Alvarez claimed, was disrespectful to the PCSD. Environmental groups had questioned the PCSD's issuance of a clearance to the mining project and a separate clearance to a plan to build a coal power plant in the province. Alvarez accused PNNI of ""unfairly blaming"" the PCSD secretariat. (4) Civil society groups, reacting to the governor's outburst, have demanded that he apologize.(4).In 2016 Secretary of the DENR Gina Lopez inspected the Rio Tuba mine. There was much rejoicing shortly afterwards among the mining firms  when she was not confirmed to the post after a parliamentary hearing where mining interest imposed their rule. In this same year 2016, FoE Japan had again issued a statement on water quality :""Friends of the Earth Japan (FoE Japan), with the cooperation of a Japanese citizen's expert, has been continuously analyzing the water quality in the communities surrounding the Coral Bay Nickel Processing Plant Project (the CBNP) and the Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Project (the RTNMP), in the municipality of Bataraza, Palawan, since 2009. Our findings of water quality analysis for these 7 years have clearly shown that Hexavalent Chromium or Cr (VI) in the Togupon River in this area has been exceeding ""Environmental Quality Standards Concerning the Protection of the Human Health"" (not exceeding 0.05 mg/L) in Japan at almost all the time in every rainy season . Based on this situation that the water contamination hasn't been improved yet, FoE Japan submitted a petition to Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (SMM), calling on the joint Investigation regarding water quality and effective mitigation measure against water contamination, from the viewpoint of preventing the long-term health damage and ensuring the security and life of the local people in the future.(2)FoE Japan insisted that it has not been possible collect yet any water samples inside of the project site. The project proponents haven't yet provided any clear answer about the haxavalent chromium in the Togupon River, either. While FoE Japan will continue its water analysis in the communities surrounding the nickel project site in Palawan, it is also recommended that the Japanese companies concerned make more cooperation and take more active measure, such as the identification of the water contamination mechanism and the information disclosure, from the viewpoint of preventing the long-term health damage and ensuring the security and life of the local people in the future.",rio-tuba-mining-corporation,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"After years of negotiations, the Government of Kenya approved the project presented by the Canadian company Tiomin Resources Inc. for the exploitation of titanium deposits located in the Kwale region. A coalition formed of local communities and human rights organizations called Coast Mining Rights Forum opposed the mega-project, as it called for the displacement of 5,000 indigenous Digo and Kamba people and would contaminate local soil and aquifers with heavy metals. In 2008-09, the Tiomin company tried to sell the rights to Jinchuan, a Chinese company. The project, started in 2013, led to forced displacements. In February 2014, it was reported that Kenya had joined the league of mineral exporters with the first shipment of 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite to China, from Kwale Mineral Sands Project, owned by Base Titanium. The firm, the Kenyan subsidiary of the Australian company Base Resources, was granted an export licence. Base Titanium made its first shipment of 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite — one of the major components found in the Titanium mineral ore — to China. Rough estimates show that 250,000 tonnes of Titanium ores will be eported per year from Kwale while some 3.2 billion tonnes of the same mineral deposits can be found in Kilifi area.

"The plant in Baia Mare, liable for the accident of January 2000, is called now Romaltyn Mining and between 2008 – April 2012 was owned by Polyus Gold, the largest gold producer in Russia. Since 2006 the company ceased all activity. According to the site report of Romaltyn Mining updated in 2012, the new planned mining activities would be performed at three different locations in Baia Mare, technologically connected by a 13.6 km long pipe network crossing the city from east to west. Cyanide would be transported by road, in solid form. Following the chemical process of gold extraction, water with tailings and cyanide compounds are discharged through the pipe route from the processing plant to the Aurul dam. The pipe route crosses the commercial and industrial area in the west of Baia Mare city, along the right bank of river Sasar. The cyanide spill of 30 January 2000 occurred within only a few months since the commencement of mining waste processing at Baia Mare, and was known as ""the second Chernobyl"" because of its devastating impact on the environment. Four weeks after the accident traces of cyanides were also identified in the Danube Delta. According to official estimates, five years were necessary for restoring fish populations in the affected rivers and 10 years for the full recovery of flora and fauna. In Szeged in Hungary, as The Guardian in February 2000, ""a flood of toxic cyanide 40km long washed down the River Tisza accompanied by a tide of dead fish, spreading the poison further downstream into the Danube and adding to the toll of environmental destruction across central Europe. The spill, which originated in northern Romania, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed last month and caused cyanide to flow into streams, has not been diluted to a safe level despite winter rains. Fishermen stretched nets between barges in Szeged, and removed five tonnes of dead fish. So far 300 tonnes have been removed from the Tisza, and from the river that carried the pollution into Hungary, the Szamos. The concentration of cyanide in the Tisza in Szeged was 2.4mg per litre. Biologists say that any level above 0.02 mg per litre is harmful to life. In Szeged in Hungary hundreds of people gathered on bridges to throw flowers into the Tisza, which is much loved in Hungary, where it is regarded as cleaner and more beautiful than the Danube. Its fish are highly prized, and the fish soup from Szeged, spiced with paprika, has until now been a national delicacy. "" The Tisza and Szamos Rivers cyanide spill was a trans-boundary environmental catastrophe. It was caused by the mine situated in Romania's Baia Mare (Nagybánya) region. One thousand m3 of cyanide and heavy metals mixed with sewage poured from the facility into the Lápos river, and then into the Szamos and Tisza rivers. The higheest concentration of the toxins measured 32.6 mg/l, 180 times higher than the allowable limit, causing massive destruction in the living world. The whole local community in Romania is now against mining in Baia Mare. They have demonstrated this by mobilizing on the streets and on social networks. They have created a page on Facebook: Stop Romaltyn Baia Mare where they bring arguments against cyanide in the industrial activity. More to that, 10 years later from the accident, in a survey made by a local newspaper, 76.6% of the people said they are against cyanide pollution in Baia Mare.",baia-mare,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO

Saudi Arabia is hungry for energy to enable large-scale seawater desalination to meet its water needs, and to drive forward its industrial development. Possible environmental impacts of uranium extraction, increased desalination activities, and a fast-paced industrial development model are compounded by the repressive and opaque nature of the Saudi regime that will stifle consultation, accountability, and mitigation to ensure some level of environmental justice.

"In June 2000, in spite of a three years global opposition campaign, led by local population and International NGOs, the World Bank financed the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, a 1,100 km (685 mile) pipeline for crude oil from southern Chad, through tropical forest, to Cameroon's Atlantic coast. The project also included the construction of 300 oil wells in Chad. The Cameroonian rainforest covers an area of about 20 million hectares, some 40 percent of the national territory. Besides posing a serious threat upon the biodiversity and the ecosystem of the country, the construction of the oil pipeline and the subsequent deforestation generated serious social conflicts, and deprived local indigenous communities of territorial resources and traditional livelihoods, especially the Bakola Pygmy people, who rely on hunting and gathering. Bantou villagers claimed Pygmies' lands as theirs and received the compensations which were due to the Pygmies. In 2002, a project by Forest Peoples Programme helped resolve some of the long-standing rivalries between the Bantou and the pygmies. Overall the compensation plan by Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COCTO) is insufficient. And so was the ""Indigenous Peoples Programme"", implemented by the FEDEC, which was not adequate to the Pygmies' needs.   The Yaounde Peoples Tribunal was launched in September 2005 by organizations supporting local communities five years protest against the project denouncing serious social and environmental impacts and investigating project related human rights violations. In operation since October 2003, local NGOs denounce the project and enumerate the numerous oil spills regularly occurring. The oil extractivist industry also threatens the fishing economy of Kibri, the Cameroon's port from where the oil exported. Far from being a poverty relief, the pipeline provokes health problems to the population living in the 242 villages where it goes through. In 2011, a complaint against the World Bank and International Finance Corporation listed the following points against COTCO's operations:  - A rise in HIV/AIDS after the laying of the pipeline -Concerns over quality and adequacy of compensation packages -Loss of livelihoods among fishermen -Inappropriate waste management -Work related accidents and inadequate compensation - Displacement of and improper compensation to, an indigenous community - Concerns about sub contractors and compensation process and levels -Concerns regarding royalties for the passage of oil through Cameroon. In spite of the multiplication of reports or monitoring entities (such as the International Advisory Group or the External Compliance Monitoring Group) following up on the situation and set up by the World Bank, the international institution has demonstrated its incapacity ""of influencing the operations of oil companies in any meaningful way, so that they become more respectful of the environment and the rights of the affected communities and workers"". The pipeline also has severe consequences on Chad. Scandals bust up denouncing that the government finances its war against the rebels in the North and East of the country with the revenues from oil. None of that money has benefited the local residents affected by the pipeline, while its route is very close to Chad's most fertile region.",oil-pipeline-project-chad-cameroon,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Starting from the energy reform, promoted by the Mexican government in 2013, the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in Mexico changed from being the exclusive activity of the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) to opening up to investments from private capital. These new legal schemes of bidding for the participation of private companies were called Rounds. Round 0 corresponded to the fields for the exploration and production of gas and oil for PEMEX (within which it can associate with private companies), and rounds 1, 2, and 3 were aimed at private companies with national or foreign capital [1]. By January 2021, 107 contracts for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons had been awarded in Mexico (38 in Round 1, 50 in Round 2 and 16 in Round 3), of which 48 are on land; 31 in shallow waters and 28 in deep waters. There are 73 companies from 20 different countries with valid contracts, including the main oil groups at the global level (BHP, Chevron, Shell, Total, Exxon Mobil, etc.) [2] (see map 2 in the banner).  In the territory of the indigenous Zoque people in northern Chiapas, these Rounds became a direct threat through Round 2.2, which the National Hydrocarbons Commission opened in August 2016 for the concession of twelve blocks (nine in the Burgos Basin between Tamaulipas and Nuevo León) and three in the Southeast Basins (two in Chiapas and one in Tabasco) [3]. In Chiapas, block 10 was planned on 42,600 hectares, in the municipalities of Tecpatán, Francisco León, and Ostuacán, with the aim of obtaining super light oil and wet gas, while block 11 was planned on 41,900 hectares in Chapultenango, Ixtacomitan, Ixtapangajoya, Pichucalco, Solosuchiapa, Sunuapa, and Teapa (Tabasco), to obtain light oil and super light oil. A total of 84,500 hectares of land in nine municipalities in northern Chiapas are threatened by the extraction of natural gas through dispossession and environmental contamination of Zoque territory [4] [5].  The announcement of Round 2.2 motivated the communities in northern Chiapas to form the Indigenous Movement of the Zoque Believing People in Defense of Life and Territory (ZODEVITE), made up of Catholic indigenous people and farmers from the territory. The Zoque people have a 3,500-year presence in the northwestern part of Chiapas, where they guard symbolic spaces such as Piogba Cotzak (Chichonal Volcano) and the Ipstejk hill (Viente Casas, now El Ocote Biosphere Reserve). ZODEVITE was inspired by Pope Francis's encyclical Laudato Si, promoted by the Social Pastoral of the Diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas, to undertake the defense of the common home – the land – which intersected with the accumulation of historical grievances caused by the government, deterioration of the living conditions of the population, impacts of climate change, and, on the other hand, processes of revaluation of ethnic identity as factors that triggered the movement in the face of the threat of the oil round [4].  The struggle of ZODEVITE is justified by the serious environmental, economic, and cultural damage that the installation of the 12 planned oil wells could cause. One of the main potential impacts is the excessive use of water (it is estimated that each well requires 20 million liters of water) and the possible contamination of springs and streams (a total of 16 streams and 4 springs of the Zoque communities are at risk) [4] [5]. Another risk is the contamination of soil and air, and changes in land use, since the land is currently dedicated to agricultural and environmental conservation activities, so that when the oil wells are installed, they would change to industrial use. This would jeopardize the food sovereignty of the communities in the region and generate serious environmental and social imbalances (changes in traditional activities, health problems, migratory displacements, etc.) [4] [5].  ZODEVITE has carried out multiple marches and protest movements, such as the one on June 22, 2017, in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, or the one on March 24, 2018, in the municipality of Francisco León, on the occasion of the 36th anniversary of the eruption tragedy of the Chichonal Volcano, which brought together more than 4,000 people from 49 Zoque villages [5] [6]. They have also denounced the irregularities in the pseudo-consultation processes carried out by the Ministry of Energy, as they have not consulted all affected communities (only rural agents were consulted); during the consultations, the MIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) was not presented; and Zoque-speaking communities did not have translators in their own language. These practices, which are quite common in consultation processes in Mexico, are always deceptive and carried out under pressure, and are a clear violation of the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples and to a free, prior, informed, and culturally adequate consultation guaranteed by articles 6 and 7 of the ILO Convention 169 signed by Mexico [4] [7].  Faced with this, the communities decided to conduct their own ""self-consultations"" through community assemblies, without government intervention, organized by the affected communities themselves and expressed in the local language. These self-consultations, carried out between October 2016 and February 2017, were conducted in 100% of the neighborhoods of all communities in the nine Zoque municipalities, and each community signed a rejection document of hydrocarbon extraction, declaring their territories free of extractive projects [4] [5] [8]. In response to this mobilization, in July 2017, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) decided to exclude blocks 10 and 11 under the argument of not having been able to carry out the consultations with the indigenous communities of the 10 affected municipalities, in terms of ILO Convention 169 [5] [9] [10].  However, the struggle of ZODEVITE is not limited to those blocks of round 2.2, as it incorporated other demands against other existing territorial threats in the region. For example, they demand the withdrawal of the Frisco mining company, owned by Carlos Slim, in Solosuchiapa, and the cancellation of the seven existing mining concessions (totaling 19,734 hectares) and the assignment of 1900 hectares by the Mexican Geological Service (SGM). They also fight for preferential electricity rates, promote the citizen initiative for a new general law on water in Mexico, suspend hydroelectric projects on several rivers in the region, and geothermal and tourist projects (geopark) in Chichonal Volcano. For this, community assemblies were spaces for reflection, articulation, and community power from which the identity and demands of the movement were woven [4] [5] (see also map 1 in the banner).  At present (2021), the Mexican government maintains within its energy plan the expansion of gas and oil extraction in the Zoque territory, on a total of 100,000 hectares, which is why the oil round project is currently temporarily suspended.",lucha-del-pueblo-zoque-contra-bloques-de-hidrocaburos-mexico,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The Manta-Manaus multimodal corridor was designed to ""connect port city of Manta on Ecuador's Pacific coast with Manaus, a bustling river port in western Brazilian"". The project was developed in 2000 within the IIRSA (Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America). The IRSA gathers more than 500 mega-infrastructures projects. The initiative for the multimodal corridor aimed at building and improving an infrastructure for storing and transporting goods (hydrocarbons, agricultural and fishing products, wood and biofuels) along the Amazon. The project included the construction of a 600 km land route from Manta to Coca (Francisco de Orellana) on the Napo river, and a 2,860 km river route to Manaus. Travelling by river from the Ecuadorian Pacific coast to Manaus would take only 10 days. It is clear that the project is important for multinational corporations in terms of time saving and the resulting economic benefits in transport between China and Brazil. The project cost was initially estimated at approximately US$ 400 million, which later rose to around US$ 800 million. Actually, some experts estimate that the final cost could top US$ 2 billion, without including the construction expenses in Peru and Brazil. Along the financial costs, environmental impediments are also at stake. As for instance, the feasibility of making the Napo river navigable 365 days a year is very low because the river's banks change over the year. As a result of these multiple barriers, little progress has been made so far in the construction of the infrastructure, except for highways starting and ending in Manta and an airport in Tena. Some of the mega-projects started in 2006 were suspended due to lack of funds, local community opposition, conflicts between construction companies and the Ecuadorian Government along with the need to carry out proper environmental impact assessments and feasibility studies. Still by January 2016, during an official presidential visit in Quito by the President of Brazil to Ecuador, Dilma Rousseff and Rafael Correa announced their still alive willingness to push forward the multimodal corridor.",manta-manaus-multimodal-corridor-ecuador-peru-brazil,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"On June 15 2017, Maeda Corporation made an important announcement regarding the planned Ofunato Port Biomass/Coal-fired Power Plant in Ofunato City, Iwate Prefecture. The company decided to switch from the initial co-firing of biomass and coal to a woody biomass-fired power plant, in line with the requirements specified in the environmental impact assessment method manual based on the Iwate Prefecture Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance. While coal-fired power plants were strongly opposed by the civil society actors, according to the company, the change is driven by the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and the imperative to reduce environmental impact, prompting Maeda Corporation to opt for biomass-only combustion. Initially, the company planned a biomass co-firing coal-fired power plant as part of their biomass-fired power generation commercialization efforts. In 2016, they completed the necessary procedures for a Type 2 project judgment for environmental impact assessment based on the prefectural ordinance. Subsequently, the prefectural governor determined that further procedures, including an environmental impact assessment, were required. Consequently, Maeda Corporation initiated work based on the prefectural environmental impact assessment ordinance. They developed an environmental impact assessment document that outlines the assessment items, surveys, and evaluation methods and conducted explanatory meetings at two locations in the city. The revision for this planned new coal-fired power plant follows similar changes in two plants in Ako City, Hyogo Prefecture, and the cancellation of another CFPP  in Ichihara City, Chiba Prefecture. Notably, this marks the first time a corporation has explicitly refered the Paris Agreement as a driving force behind the plan change, highlighting the growing significance of global climate commitments in shaping energy projects[1][2].As a result, four out of the 49 domestic coal-fired power plant construction plans initiated since 2012 were either cancelled or modified. According to Kiko Network, as of June 2017, many of the remaining CFFP were still in the planning phase, with two already in operation. Kiko Network (KIKO), an environmental NGO opposing the construction of new coal-fired power plants, expressed appreciation for the revised plan. However, KIKO also highlighted the need for clarity regarding biomass fuel procurement sources and urged a further commitment to reduce the environmental burden[1].The original plan for the thermal power plant entailed constructing a biomass co-firing coal-fired power plant with an output of 112,000 kW on a 117 hectare site in the Nagahama-Yamaguchi industrial area of Ofunato Port. The newly planned power plant would rely on 1,360 tons of biomass (wood pellets) daily, approximately 440,000 tons annually. While the policy is to procure biomass through imports primarily, a portion will be sourced from local forests and woodlands. The active utilization of local wood as fuel is expected to stimulate regional revitalization and yield positive effects on the local economy, such as job creation. However, specific details regarding the import ratio were not been disclosed. Furthermore, the corporation claimed that 25% of the site would be dedicated to green space, ensuring a substantial environmental conservation component. Construction was to commence in the 2018 fiscal year if all procedures were completed as scheduled, with operations starting in fiscal year 2021 [2][5].However, after switching from coal to biomass, the residents of Ofunato City, who were also survivors of the Tsunami disaster in 2011, opposed the project. On June 18 2017, Maeda Construction Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo) had conducted a re-explanatory meeting at the Akasaki district public hall to engage with residents regarding the environmental impact assessment method for the project. During the meeting, residents expressed concerns and shared opinions regarding the potential impact on the landscape, noise, exhaust gas, and thermal effluent in the surrounding area and fisheries. Many residents expressed opposition to the plant [3][4].However, the meeting at the Akasaki venue did not provide a detailed explanation of the project, necessitating another meeting. On that day, 32 residents participated, and Hiroshi Katayama, the project manager and deputy director of the Business Strategy Headquarters, attended on behalf of the company to outline the environmental impact assessment method [3][4].According to the provided information, the planned site for the power plant was the southern section of the industrial area, covering approximately 5.3 hectares. The power plant will utilize a boiler to burn wood pellets, producing steam to operate a turbine for electricity generation. The exhaust gas from incineration will be treated with a dust collector before being released into the atmosphere through a chimney. Water for the plant will be sourced from approximately three wells surrounding the Morikawa River and piped to the planned site. The plant's drainage will be treated at the on-site drainage facility and discharged into the sewage system[4].The construction period was scheduled to span approximately 34 months from 2018 to 2021, with commissioning anticipated to occur in the fiscal year 2033, requiring approximately six months. The environmental impact assessment method document prioritizes ten items for evaluation, including air quality, noise, vibration, groundwater level, animal and ecosystem impact, landscape, areas where human-nature interaction occurs, waste management, and greenhouse gases. The document will conduct further investigations, predictions, and evaluations on air quality, noise, vibration, groundwater level, and other aspects. Additionally, the prefecture temporarily suspended the public offering for the sale of the planned site to explore potential uses related to the other sea port project[4]. Regarding the temporary suspension of public offerings for the same industrial site by the prefecture, Maeda Corporation stated, ""It would be preferable if we could coexist with the use of the other seaport project. If the prefecture decides not to make a public offer, we will be left with no choice but to cancel the project.""During the public meeting, participants raised concerns regarding the impact of high-temperature water discharge on the bay's ecosystem and the presence of dioxins in the exhaust gas. Furthermore, during the Q&A session with residents, the topic of landscape, highlighted by the prefecture during the Type 2 project evaluation, emerged as a point of discussion. In the Type 2 project, the company proposed the installation of a 20-meter-high soundproof wall around the plant to mitigate noise issues associated with its operation. One of the participants inquired, ""Did you consult with the city and local fishermen's cooperatives when developing materials for the Type 2 project?"" The company responded, ""Generally, consultations in the Type 2 evaluation process are conducted by the contractor. However, we also seek opinions from local residents, the city, and ultimately the governor regarding the documents created for the environmental impact assessment. We are open to making necessary corrections based on their feedback.""[4] Another participant expressed concerns, saying, ""I have a house in front of the plant, and I won't be able to see anything with those walls. I have children, and when the tsunami hit, they had to move from our original home to a different place. I came here with these thoughts. While it may be a viable business, it's not suitable for this location."" Residents continued to ask questions and express their opinions from opposing standpoints [4].By June 2023, with increasing opposition, 23 coal-fired power plant units have been cancelled in Japan. For the case of the Ofunato Biomass/coal Power Plant project, further development cannot be identified to this date [1][5][6][7].",ofunato-port-biomass-coal-fired-power-plant,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"In the conflict over the Lemoiz (or Lemóniz) nuclear power plant between 1972 and 1984 is where the highest level of mobilization, social response and violence was reached in the Spanish state. As Ladislao Martínez summarized years later, there was a mixture of conventional protest actions, such as demonstrations, report submissions, or outreach events, boycotts against Iberduero, boycotts by the workers themselves, sabotages against various facilities of the promoting company, nearly suicidal attacks by ETA, and the attacks of ETA against engineers of the company. Following Ladislao Martínez's narrative and interpretation, one of the founders of Ecologistas en Acción years later, although the groups in the fight against Lemóniz were numerous and diverse, it is fair to recognize the prominence of the Defense Commission of a Non-Nuclear Basque Coast, created in the early years of the 1970s from various neighborhood, cultural, ecological, and social groups and with members such as José Allende Landa. It had the implicit support of the different nationalist left-wing formations. The first major street mobilization against Lemóniz took place on August 29, 1976, when more than 50,000 people demanded a non-nuclear Basque coast, rejecting not only Lemóniz but other projects that were under discussion at the time (Deva or Ea-Ispaster). At the forefront of the demonstration were a diverse representation of the cultural world and prominent intellectuals. Among them was Chillida, one of whose sculptures was for many years the most representative icon of the rejection of nuclear energy. The peak of social mobilization occurred in 1977. On March 31, the Provincial Council of Vizcaya modified the General Urban Planning Plan of the Plencia-Munguía region, where the plant was located, changing it from rural to industrial. In June, the city councils of Munguía and Lemóniz appeal the reclassification of the land decreed by the Provincial Council. Thus, social rejection already had some support from the closest institutions. The Defense Commission of a Non-Nuclear Basque Coast requested a new demonstration in Bilbao hoping to surpass the success of the previous year. The government denied permission. Finally, the Civil Government decided to authorize the march on July 14, and more than 200,000 people took to the streets in what may have been the largest anti-nuclear demonstration in the world of all time. There was talk of a referendum, but the two branches of ETA (m) and (pm) intervened in the conflict. Two bombs exploded in the plant's dining room. In December, ETA (m) attacked the Civil Guard barracks guarding the plant, and a member of the command was wounded and died days later. In March 1978, two plant workers died in an attack. In June 1978, another worker died in an attack. On March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island accident occurred near Harrisburg (USA). The Basque government agreed to appoint a commission of experts that would travel to the USA in April 1979. Their report, presented in June, described the incident and included the evaluations of the experts. Those proposed by the PSE-PSOE and Euzkadiko Ezkerra concluded that ""we consider it convenient and recommend to the [General Basque] Council to stop the Lemóniz nuclear plant."" The conclusions of the members proposed by the PNV and UCD were quite different. Amid growing tension in August 1979, the Defense Commission called for a twelve-day march that, after traversing the Basque Country, concluded in Lemóniz. Despite strong repression, clashes with the police were daily. Nevertheless, more than 15,000 people attended the final event in an atmosphere of euphoria. On December 27, 1979, the city council of Lemóniz executively ordered the suspension of land use and construction activities of the plant. But the pressure from Iberduero was felt, and they managed to get the Council of Ministers to reclassify, using exceptional powers, the land use. On June 13, 1980, the Basque regional parliament approved the holding of a referendum that never took place. In the last years, a serious discipline problem began to appear among the workers building the plant. Many engineers openly stated that future plant malfunctions due to these sabotages could not be ruled out. But Iberduero was determined to continue with the project and had strong political support from the central government of UCD and from the majority of the PNV. ETA(m) escalated to the most violent action, kidnapping the chief engineer, José Ma Ryan, who was found murdered on January 29, 1981. Iberduero understood that they could no longer continue with the project and considered the formation of a public company to continue the work. On May 5, 1982, coinciding with the founding of that company, ETA (m) ended the life of the new chief engineer of the plant, Ángel Pascual. It was the end. Everyone already understood that Lemóniz was not going to be completed. However, it was not until 1984 that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government decreed the nuclear moratorium affecting Lemóniz (I and II), Valdecaballeros (I and II), and Trillo II. There is a fairly widespread feeling, as Ladislao Martínez points out, that there was not sufficient condemnation of the eco-pacifist movement in the face of ETA's extreme violence. He writes: ""To understand this, the hardness of the moment must not be forgotten. In almost all the texts published at that time, there are references to the murder by the police of Gladys del Estal on June 3, 1979, in a demonstration against the Bardenas polygon, which also referred to the planned nuclear power plant in Tudela.""",lemoiz-basque-country-spain,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"On February 15, the Cabinet committee on economic affairs approved the award of contracts for exploration of 44 small oil fields across India. Neduvasal, a fertile village of the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu, is one of the 31 contract areas where exploration of hydrocarbons is to be taken up.  These fields were offered under a new policy for small fields known as the Discovered Small Field (DSF) policy, 2015, launched to unlock the hydrocarbon potential of small and marginal fields. This project is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious plan to reduce oil imports by 10 percent by 2022. Agitations in the region began soon after the approval. Drought hit farmers, college students and even scientists protested this project claiming that it could lead to an ecological disaster in the area. Geologists, experts and local residents claimed various reasons for this resistance. There is a fear of displacement of farmers, occupation of cultivable land, impact on agriculture, saline water intrusion, contamination of the ground water system and soil. Some believe this project is tapping into methane and shale reservoirs, which have larger impacts. While this is being denied, the government official website states shale activity in the same region. This also comes after the new Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) policy was passed. This will provide for a uniform licensing system to cover all hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane etc. under a single licensing framework.Pudukottai is usually a dry region. But the villagers have toiled for around 30 years, used borewells extensively, and changed the landscape. Neduvasal's fertile soil now grows paddy, groundnut, pepper, cocoa and cucumber. And so the villagers fear losing their land, crops and livelihood to the project. In response, a press release from the Government dismissed these concerns and claimed that the project will not have any environmental impact. A statutory environmental public hearing is required to be held under the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification (EIA) of 2006, which was not held before this project.  Nityanand Jayaraman, an environmentalist, filed a Right to Information petition regarding the EIA of this project. While the response showed that the company had not prepared an environment impact assessment report, it also refused to share copies of the environmental clearances secured for the project, stating they contained ""commercial confidence information"". Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan and state minister C Vijayabaskar held talks with the villagers on March 9, assuring them that a meeting would be arranged with Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan where concerns of the villagers would be addressed. A few representatives of the villages were called to Delhi to Mr. Pradhan. He assured them that the project would not be carried out against their will. Subsequently the first phase of 22-day strident protest was called off. But in April the Union government signed an agreement with Gem Laboratories (a company based out of Davangere in Karnataka, started by late BJP Member of Parliament, G Mallikarjunappa) for the exploration in the Neduvasal DSF. The agitation stirred back. Though the contract is with Gem Laboratories, the villagers have mainly been targeting ONGC as it remains the largest driller in the Cauvery basin, while others are small players. ONGC had started work in Neduvasal in 2007. Oil wells were drilled but shut down later due to it not being viable economically. These wells have now been handed to Gem laboratories for the current project. Though the project has come to a temporary halt at the moment, there has been no indication of a permanent call-off. Villagers have been orally protesting and distributing pamphlets. A case has been filed with the National Green Tribunal (NGT).",hydrocarbon-extraction-a-threat-to-livelihood-in-neduvasal-pudukkottai-district-cauvery-delta,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"In the Matanza-Riachuelo basin, which crosses 14 municipalities, about ""15,000 industries discharge effluents into the river and chemical manufacturers are responsible for more than a third of the pollution"". ""In 2008, the soil on the river banks contained levels of zinc, lead, copper, nickel, and chromium above recommended levels."" An internal audit carried out by the Matanza Riachuelo Basin Authority (Acumar) in eleven municipalities concluded in 2013 that 70 percent of the open-air landfills that had been eradicated from the Matanza-Riachuelo basin reappeared. ""Out of the 167 inspected landfills, a total of 120 were observed with waste and 47 clean,"" the internal document of the organization, commanded by the Supreme Court of Justice to lead the clean-up plan of Argentina's most contaminated river, states. [1].  In 2016, the Supreme Court of Justice exposed the poor performance of that organization, the Matanza Riachuelo Basin Authority (Acumar), during the public hearing convened by the highest court to demand accountability for the ruling that orders the national, provincial, and city states to clean the basin. In 2016, the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lorenzetti, had to remind in a public hearing that the clean-up of the Riachuelo was ordered by a judicial ruling of July 8, 2008 [2]. In this hearing, representatives of the ""camino de sirga"" were expelled, while Andres Nápoli, a member of FARN representing the collegial body comprising the Office of the Public Defender and several NGOs, stated: ""Acumar's management problems largely explain the failure to comply with the ruling."" Regarding housing, one of the hottest topics of the hearing, he stated: ""Housing is built on land with low real estate value and poor land quality"" [2]. As indicated by Elio Brailowsky [3], the situation of the Riachuelo at the end of 2016 continues to be a major environmental problem in Argentina. Acumar ensures that the Supreme Court's ruling given eight years ago has been 20% fulfilled. However, they are referring to a single indicator, which is the number of houses built to relocate the high-risk population. As for water quality, they have been unwilling to provide the Supreme Court with indicators comparing mercury, pesticides, bacteria levels between years. The ruling is not fulfilled due to a set of interests. On one hand, the sewage issue - Aysa continues to discharge sewage into the Riachuelo without treatment, it's sewers for the entire party of Matanza. If Aysa does nothing, nothing will change. On the other hand, the issue of industrial pollution that Acumar should have ordered the industries to comply with international parameters, that is, how much can be dumped into a river per contaminant. What Acumar did (according to Brailowsky) is to authorize them to legally dump the same amount they were dumping into the river clandestinely. They whitewashed clandestine pollution. So, if Aysa discharges sewage and industries dump the same amount of pollutants as before, there is no reason for the river to be better. Acumar authorities say that 5.2 billion dollars were spent in these 8 years, and at the same public hearing, the Office of the Auditor General of the Nation says that it cannot explain how they were spent. Brailowsky maintains that until now, the public hearings at the Supreme Court of Justice have been a kind of choreography in which an incompetent official would say ""I don't have data"" and the Supreme Court would rebuke them ""go home and do your homework."" And then, another public hearing would be called, another official would arrive and say the same thing, and the court would rebuke them again, and so on, year after year, each official claiming not to know anything because they are new, or because the previous official resigned and did not leave any information. In fact, there was already a law in 1871 that prohibited polluting industries in the Riachuelo during the presidency of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.   In the City of Buenos Aires, there were several serious epidemics in the years 1868/69 and 1871. From then on, there was a very large social and neighborhood movement to try to improve the sanitary situation of the City, and one of the issues that came into discussion was the very high levels of pollution in the Riachuelo. As a result, the Legislature of the Province of Buenos Aires passed a Law ordering the eradication of polluting industries from the Riachuelo, which at that time were basically the salting establishments, facilities that were slaughterhouses and made salted beef in very poor hygiene conditions. Then, the order was fulfilled. They voted to ban them, they did it in 1871, and for a few years the Riachuelo was cleaned up, like an area similar to the Delta playgrounds today where people went to spend the weekend, to row, etc. The owners of the salting establishments brought a lawsuit, which reached the Supreme Court of Justice, and at the end of the 19th century, with more courage than the current Supreme Court, it ruled that public health came before private business and validated the law expelling them. We are talking about an area in which 3.5 million people live along 64 kilometers. According to Brailowky, ""when you tell anyone from abroad who understands these topics, the number of people at health risk from the Riachuelo, the indifference of our political system to this, the indifference of the media, they simply don't understand what's going on, there's no way to understand this level of indifference from outside Argentina."" In the succinct opinion of Gabriela Merlinsky [4] who has been studying the problem for 20 years: ""there has been a change in environmental perception in Argentina in the light of many environmental conflicts -such as those in Esquel and Gualeguaychú-, conflicts related to the landfill, access to drinking water, pollution of watercourses, and more recently also with fumigated towns. But the turning point was the intervention of the Supreme Court of Justice (in 2006), when it declared original jurisdiction in the case (driven by residents and NGOs). By saying that it was a State issue and relating it to Article 41 of the National Constitution, which refers to the right to a healthy environment, and generating an institutional mechanism (the Matanza Riachuelo Basin Authority - ACUMAR) to enforce that right, the problem became visible."" But there is no awareness of the basin, according to Merlinsky: ""between the upper, middle, and lower basin, 14 municipalities are included. Avellaneda has an interesting relationship with the river, because there were rowing clubs and recovered spaces there. La Boca undoubtedly identifies with the river, La Boca is the Riachuelo. People living in Villa Jardín, in Lanús, live in the oldest villa in Buenos Aires, from the 1930s. There are movies that portrayed those times and a lot of written history. In La Matanza, there is an area with a very interesting natural reserve. In Esteban Echeverría, there is the Laguna de Rocha, for which a large number of people did a lot to declare it a natural reserve, and now there are guided tours every weekend. It is a huge territory, larger than the City of Buenos Aires.""",riachuelo-matanzas-buenos-aires,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"""When pine needles fall, they acidify the ground and make it inhabitable by any plant to grow there."" – Jonathan Cook. The Jewish National Fund has designated Sunday 5th February as 'Green Sunday,' when it encourages people to donate money to 'plant trees in Israel.'The Jewish National Fund is a non-profit organization founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in the Ottoman Palestine and later Israel territories or Jewish settlements. JNF is active in afforestation and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08 km2) and drained swamps, like those in the Hula Valley.The JNF promotes an exclusionary, discriminatory brand of environmentalism. From its inception in 1901 – when the JNF controlled but a single olive grove in a land where 94% of its neighbors were Arab – to today, working closely with the Israel government, the JNF directly owns 13% of Israel's land and effectively controls another 80%. The JNF's constitution has explicitly stated that its land cannot be rented, leased, sold to or worked by non-Jews. [6]Its founding mission and current constitution explicitly state its colonial purpose: the acquiring of the land and property of indigenous Palestinians held in reserve for exclusive settlement and use by Jews. These forestation projects serve two purposes: to hide the ethnic cleansing of those Palestinians whose home it was and to prevent Palestinians from returning to their homes.[12]Throughout the rst half of the 20th century, the JNF – helping to exile hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families, bulldoze their homes and clear the land to make way for Jewish settlement – bought large tracts of land from absentee landowners, evicted local Arab tenant farmers, uprooted natural vegetation of olive, carob, and pistachio trees, and planted throughout the land, in place of indigenous arboreta, vast swaths of European pinera (conifers) and eucalyptus trees.[11]The Jewish National Fund (JNF) centrally describes itself, on its home pages, as clean and green. However, the information tab on their website also contains political, nationalistic, and military subtexts. Susan Nathan, an Israeli National living in the Palestinian town of Tamra, writes that for Israel, ""trees are a weapon of continuing dispossession."" First was the National Carmel Park Law in which the ""state uprooted natural vegetation of olive, carob and fruit trees for which the area was renowned and which the villagers had cultivated for generations and surrounded them instead with useless pines."" These pines are aging, demanding more water and they are more prone to problems like pests, disease, and re.[5,6] One of the important reasons that some of Israel's forests are burning, such as the wave in 2016, is because pine trees are well known for their high degree of flammability, especially in an arid environment like the climate of Palestine provides. The reason this type of tree was planted, rather than a more endemic species, is because of the role of the Ashkenazim in denying the Zionist imaginary over other Jewish ethnic groups (Sephardi, Mizrahi, Ethiopians, etc.). Planting ofِ European pine trees in Israel provides a visual representation of the Israeli claim of ""exceptionalism"" in the region, and was meant to make the land appears as an extension of Europe (the Swiss mountains are often cited as an example) in a geographical context that 19th-century orientalists mostly described as arid and deserted — Palestine was more often characterized by its southern desert than through its northern continuity with the fertile lands of Lebanon and the Golan Heights. The Pine forests were planted to guard and expand settlements built atop stolen land and, after 1967, to seize and divide Palestinian territory within east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.[9,4]{Note that the stone pine (Pinus pinea) has been planted in the region for hundreds of years, and producing a rich pine nut that is used for cooking and for trade.  That is *not* the pine tree that is being planted by the JNF. Rather, exotic pine trees are being planted.}After the Nakba and mass expulsion of more than 75% of the indigenous Palestinians in 1948, the JNF continued to violate international law by expropriating lands of Palestinian refugees and planting forests and parks over the ruins of their villages. In the 1950s, the JNF's UK branch funded the planting of the 'British Park' over the ruins of two forcibly depopulated Palestinian villages, Ajjur and Zakariyya.  The JNF claims that the trees are growing in Israel, therefore expanding land confiscation around illegal Jewish settlements. Pine trees, which grow fast, destroy all other small plants because of their acidity and ultimately make the land unusable for Palestinian shepherds.[3]Max Bluthenthal in his piece ""The Carmel wildfire is burning all illusions in Israel."" put it as such: ""The pine trees themselves were instruments of concealment, strategically planted by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) on the sites of the hundreds of Palestinian villages the Zionist militias evacuated and destroyed in 1948. With forests sprouting up where towns once stood, those who had been expelled would have nothing to come back to. Meanwhile, to outsiders beholding the strangely Alpine landscape of northern Israel for the first time, it seemed as though the Palestinians had never existed. And that was exactly the impression the JNF intended to create. The practice that David Ben Gurion and other prominent Zionists referred to as ""redeeming the land"" was, in fact, the ultimate form of greenwashing.""After the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel took over Palestinian villages in the area between No man's Land and the West Bank, which were then razed on the orders of Israeli general Yitzhak Rabin, with 7,000–10,000 inhabitants expelled and 1,464 homes demolished.[Oren, 2002] The Israeli army, after razing Imwas and Yalo villages to the ground, refused to let the refugees return home for ""security reasons."" The JNF got funded from Canadian taxpayers to build Canada Park which rests on Imwas and Yalo, which are in the Palestinian territory. However, JNF Canada has always advertised the park to be in Israel. In a fundraising letter from September 1984, JNF Canada wrote: ""Income tax receipts will be issued for all your contributions and your donation will help complete the Grove in Canada Park, in Israel..."" according to a report by the Canadian human rights group Independent Jewish Voices (IJV).  The JNF uses this tactic to further dispossess land by using trees to cover up destroyed villages then claim they are part of Israel and not the Palestinian territory.[7,3]An ongoing $600-million, 10-year JNF program called Blueprint Negev seeks to develop reservoirs, pine afforestation and water conservation programs in the Negev desert at the expense of more than 150,000 Palestinian Bedouin, whose 'unrecognised' villages, as a direct result of Israel's policies, already lack electricity, running water and sewage disposal.[8]The use of trees by JNF is a type of ethnic cleansing and have become akin to occupation soldiers, removing the main image of the land's heritage to something else to make it look like Palestinian heritage doesn't belong here. Revealed documents describe the ways Israel prevented Arabs from returning to villages they had left in 1948, even after the restrictions on them had been lifted.  At a meeting held in November 1965 at the oce of Shmuel Toledano, the prime minister's adviser on Arab affairs, there was a discussion about villages that had been left behind and that Israel did not want to be repopulated, according to one document. To ensure that, the state had the Jewish National Fund plant trees around and in them.[14]once the structures on them had been razed, and the land had been parceled out, forested and subject to proper supervision – their definition as closed military zones could be lifted. Also, most of the parks the JNF has built are over the remains of Palestinian villages that were razed and pushed out of their land [11]. The parallels with European colonization of the American continent are obvious, and in a cruel twist of historical irony, the construction, by JNF Canada, of Israel's Canada National Park, covering over the destroyed Palestinian village of 'Imwas in the mid-1980s, was initiated as a simultaneous twinning project along with Toronto's Downsview Park, which sits atop unacknowledged First Nations territory.[8]Over the years, many organisations and people have lead resistance based campaigns against the atrocities of the Jewish National Fund. Most notably the works of the BDS have revealed the works of the JNF inside Palestine and have continually pressured a lot of countries to boycott the works of the JNF or keeping them exempt from taxes, such as in the United States, Canada, and over 50 other countries. Recently Canada has accused the JNF of funding the Israeli military. Also in 2018, Cologne-based bank, Bank for Social Economy, is alleged to cut ties with the JNF.",greenwashing-by-the-jewish-national-fund-and-trees-as-a-weapon-of-dispossession-israel,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Haiyan County is under the administration of Jiaxing City, in the north of Zhejiang province, China, situated on the north shore of Hangzhou Bay and includes the north end of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. It covers an area of 503 km2, and the population is 370,000. [1] In 2007, the daily production of domestic waste in Haiyan County was 212.78 tons; while in 2016, it had increased to 494.59 tons.[2] Most of Haiyan's household waste used to be processed at incineration plants in other counties, but since late 2015 the plants were so overloaded that the operators refused to burn waste from outside their own area, leaving Haiyan's landfill sites close to full. [3] As the government stated, ""without new facilities to deal with the waste, the county will soon see severe pollution from a flood of waste."" Therefore, the county government decided to build a waste to energy plant in its Economic Development Zone. On 12 April 2016, a report on site selection of the waste incineration plant was released by the Housing and Urban-Rural Construction Bureau of Haiyan County, saying it was needed to ""help dispose of the 450 tons of solid waste that residents are generating every day."" [4]Local residents had no knowledge about the project before the announcement of the site selection report, as there was neither detailed explanation on the current status and predicament of domestic waste disposal in Haiyan County nor advanced introduction on domestic or foreign domestic waste disposal experience. After the official publicity of the site selection report, local residents quickly launched a public campaign online through WeChat, Weibo and web forums and voiced concerns about the potential health risks from emissions. Until 19 April 2016, a vote initiated on a official/public WeChat account ""Haiyan Micro Distance"" had a total of 7039 users participated, of which 96% expressed opposition to the project. More articles were published on other official/public WeChat accounts to describe the hazards of waste incinerators, coupled with pictured of emitting smoking Waste-to-Energy plants. [5]People started to mobilize each other through various means, such as WeChat circles, groups or Weibo posts and agreed to protest and demonstrate in front of the Haiyan County government and on the street on April 20, 2016. On the 20th, hundreds of local residents marched outside the Xitangqiao Township Government and Haiyan County Government to protest against the proposed incineration plant, holding up banners like ""We want life! No to pollution!"" [6] Some protesters blocked roads and attacked and injured a number of police officers, government officials and by standers, some of them also were injured by the police wielding batons and tear gas. [7][3]On 21 April 2016, through its official Sina Weibo account, the Haiyan County Government announced that the waste incineration plant would be halted. The same account posted series of messages on April 20th and 21st, trying to respond to some questions on the project. [8] ""It is confusing to see some netizens who harbor evil intent publish untrue and exaggerated comments and post pictures of other regions to mislead the public and spread rumors,"" the Haiyan government said in a Weibo post, after protests continuing into 20th April affected local traffic. The government also explained that the authorities will strictly follow normative procedures and promised that public opinions will be heard. [9]""We know a trash incinerator is useful and effective, but the local government is slack in supervision in pollution control,"" one resident, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times. [9]The Haiyan government argued on Weibo that the incineration plant's influence on the surrounding environment will be effectively limited, claiming that it is hyperbolic to say that the plant will cause severe air pollution. [10]At the beginning of 2017, Haiyan County vigorously promoted the classification and reduction of domestic waste, which led to a 20% reduction of waste to be treated, while there were still about 400 tons of waste to be treated every day. The classification and reduction only slowed down the growth of waste, which is just ""governing the symptoms without curing for the root cause"". [2]On 19 September 2017, China Everbright International Limited (""Everbright International"" or ""Group"") announced that the Group has recently secured Haiyan Waste-to-energy Project (""Haiyan Project"" or the ""Project""). According to Everbright International, the new ""Haiyan Project will be invested in and constructed on a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) model for a concession period of 30 years (construction period inclusive). The Project will be invested, constructed, operated and maintained by a project company jointly established by Everbright International and a state-owned enterprise of the People's Government of Haiyan County. The Group will hold an 80% equity stake in the project company. The Project has a designed daily household waste processing capacity of 1,200 tonnes. The Project Phase I is designed to have a daily household waste processing capacity of 800 tonnes, commands an investment of approximately RMB525 million, and is expected to generate 80,000,000 kWh of green electricity annually. It is equipped with two self-developed 400 tonnes/day mechanic grate furnaces and a 20MW turbine power generator. The gas emissions will fully comply with the Euro 2010 Standard. "" [11]Faced with various concerns and doubts raised by the people about the project, the previously halted waste incineration project had not been resumed until June 2018. The County Government took a lot of measures to dispel the doubts from the local residents, for instance: convening symposiums, carrying out house-to-house talks and organizing groups of people to go out for field visit, so as to strive for their support and understanding of the project. [2][12] According to an acknowledge addressed by the Haiyan County Government to Everbright International in July 2019, the Haiyan Waste-to-Energy Project started its operation from March 2019.

"The Mdloti River passes through the Hazelmere Dam, continues next to factories and industrial parks, and by the Verulam Wastewater Treatment Works before feeding into La Mercy Lagoon, where people often swim and fish. It is not only a recreational area for the nearby city Mount Moreland, but it is also a critical source of livelihood and fresh water for nearby villages such as La Mercy and Umdloti home to low-income black populations, all within a few kilometers of the river, have long suffered from water pollution [3]. As early as 2013, environment journalist Tony Carnie reported that pollution in Mdloti River had been traced to Verulam. In 2017, the river became sticky and foamy near Mount Moreland [2]. This sparked an investigation by the Department of Water and Sanitation, which slapped the municipality and Verulam with Section 19 compliance orders. National environmental authorities warned the eThekwini municipality to mitigate the pollution or face criminal prosecution, but nothing ended up happening [1].In January 2020, the Mdloti River turned inky black and smelly primarily owing to poor sludge management from Verulam. Pollution levels were so high that fish were dying from a lack of oxygen. Moreover, for the past 3 seasons, barn swallows that used to roost in the wetlands and attract hundreds of visitors have vanished. Climate change, habitat destruction, agriculture, and low-flying air traffic from King Shaka International Airport, which opened 10 years ago, may also be responsible [1]. Angie Wilken, the chairperson of the Mount Moreland Conservancy, said that the river was the worst it has been in 25 years, even eroding the rubber from boot soles when stepping into the water [3].Coastal watchdog groups and political parties, and outraged residents, including Jennifer Beresford, thus began mobilizing against the municipality to act. According to Beresford, illegal dumping has been ongoing since 2009 and has been reported many times without success. As she explained, ""For many years our community in Mount Moreland has been having a problem with sewage from the Verulam sewage plant flowing into the Mdloti River ... The problem has now reached unprecedented proportions and is a danger to humans, as well as wildlife and the environment"" [2].  Environmental health officials did a site inspection on December 19, 2019, during which the river appeared clear upstream of Verulam. Yet downstream, where effluent is discharged after Verulam's treatment, the river appeared highly polluted [2]. Investigations by the Department of Water and Sanitation found high levels of E. coli and chemical contamination in the river, but these results were not released to the public [5]. Beresford escalated the issue to the municipal water and sanitation department and pressed the municipality for the results of laboratory water quality tests and copies of any department reports on the problem [1]. Yet, as she reported, ""Inspectors have been sighted taking repeated samples. But we are concerned because we are unable to get test results due to internal problems. When we do get results, they say the water is fine, which cannot be true"" [3].Conservation and Environmental Affairs spokesperson Joshua Mazibuko said that the root cause for the pollution at the wastewater plant was a result of years of neglect and the fact that the ageing infrastructure of the treatment plant was long outdated: ""The Mdloti river neglect and pollution is a classic example of a government that has totally isolated itself from the poor and has thus totally forgotten about their plight"" [4]. Civil society organisations have called on municipalities to invoke the National Water Act and to start dealing with businesses that dump chemicals, effluent and waste into water systems including untreated sewage from failing wastewater treatment plants. They have also been conducting their own investigations, hoping to follow up with fines and legal action depending on their research findings [2]. Yet the department has been slow to enforce protocol and needs to commit to expanding preventative maintenance and not tolerating impunity. Verulam is not merely an exception, as many of eThekwini's 27 wastewater treatment works face serious problems with the disposal of sludge. sludge is supposed to be removed and disposed of at municipal landfill sites, or ideally used as fertilizer, but this rarely happens owing to corrupt removal contracting practices leaving untreated waste issues largely unchecked [6].",verulam-waterworks-pollutes-mdloti-river-and-la-mercy-lagoon-in-ethekwini-south-africa,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO

"Typhoon Yolanda and its aftermathsTyphoon Yolanda (local name: Haiyan) is one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. It hit a vast area of the Philippines in 2013 causing 6,000 deaths, more than 30.000 injured and almost one thousand disappearances [1]. The national provinces affected by the typhoon were 60 over 80 for a total number of 1.2 million houses destroyed, with a 4 meter surge in the sea level [5]. A local survivor affirms, ""It was apocalypse experienced in just a few hours, with everything - people, homes, every semblance of life and structure - devastated. And what was left after that scale of destruction? The men and women of Basey would say ""Waray,"" , which means 'nothing'"" [5].Extreme events, such as natural disasters and crop failures, exacerbate existing global inequality, stretching the resources of vulnerable states already struggling to provide for their citizens [2]. Post typhoon Yolanda recovery work was frustratingly slow, especially in Tacloban City where post-disaster relief seemingly became mired in political contestations and general disarray. In Haiyan-affected communities, the high vulnerability rates were largely a result of Leyte's approach to urban planning, changes in the demography due to displacement and migration, ineffectual post-disaster government services, and the insatiable livelihood opportunities especially among the marginalized sectors [2]. Small makeshift houses have been built among the ruins along some of the city's coastal villages. These are no-build zones, but residents said they had no choice to but settle there again as they continue to wait for houses promised by the government 2 years after Yolanda struck [5].LGBTQIA's differential recoveryIn the aftermaths of Typhoon Yolanda, transgender and gay people not only had their lives been forever changed with the shock of a super storm that tore apart their household, belongings, and people they knew and loved, but they also faced discrimination and challenges like no other, as people who were just trying to survive and get access to the same basic human rights as anyone else [4]. Despite the special focus on gender, programs and services offered in the disaster rehabilitation and recovery efforts in the Philippine setting are bound by the man-woman binary. This idea reinforces an essentialist view on femininity and masculinity that portrays men and women as one, homogenous group where all members have the same capacities and vulnerabilities in times of natural hazard. It must be taken into consideration that intersecting and diverse power relations exist in these groups of people who have diverse needs [7]. Existing disaster policies and practices foster 'compulsory heterosexuality' [8] where sexual minorities are stigmatized and discriminated due to their sexual orientation and gender identity [9]. In particular, sexual minorities are disregarded socially, economically, and institutionally in dealing with vulnerability and resiliency in increasing capacities. Existing DRR policies embody heteronormative norms and values in both the everyday life and during disasters, making people outside the man-woman framing more vulnerable when faced with natural hazards [9]. They do not have access to cultural, social, economic, and political structures, which worsens their vulnerability [7]. In post-disaster contexts, the most pressing need, particularly for LGBTQIA people are suitable livelihood options. The usual options open to LGBTQIA people are limited and gender-stereotypical, falling between carpentry or fishing for men (which are dominated by straight men) and cooking for women. Trans women's needs are just not suited to the current offerings. As Pierce Docena – a Professor in Social Sciences at the University of Philippines – stated, these heteronormative expectations are so deeply entrenched, not even Haiyan could disrupt them [3]. Disaster events have different powers. They can reveal and accelerate already existing processes and intensifying pre-existing inequalities. The political choices and the territorial conversions put into practice in the aftermaths of natural disasters can fall into so-called Disaster Capitalism outcomes [10]. The combination of all the previous elements can, however, also lead to the birth of social movements committed in local struggles and claims for human rights and justice. In any case, natural disasters change lives and territories, especially those who were suffering already existing conditions of vulnerability.LGBTQ activist and Professor Pierce Docena affirmed: [The disaster] opened my eyes to the realities confronted by various LGBT people as they worked to rebuild after such unthinkable loss and devastation. [...] Meeting other LGBT people and hearing their stories taught me valuable lessons about intersectionality and how privilege works especially in times of disaster. For those advocating for the environment, we need to understand that climate justice is not separate from social justice. Everything is connected and all forms of oppression are systemic and linked [4]. Another personal story coming from Nityalila shows the importance of combining the LGBTQIA struggles with the ones of the climate movement. Growing up in the Philippines, we are familiar with experiencing storms. In 2002, my family's business suffered greatly due to typhoon Milenyo. The hard work that my parents built for 35 years was severely crippled in a couple of hours. [...] Since then, climate change has become very personal. As a musician, I use my voice as a tool to raise consciousness on the lives at stake due to the climate crisis. But when I personally witnessed the impacts of Haiyan, I realised that raising awareness was not enough. It was time to take collective action. [...] I believe that both the LBGTQIA and climate movement are about fighting for our lives. The LGBTQIA movement struggles with its own impacts such as discrimination, mental health issues, and suicide. Aside from extreme weather events, the climate movement struggles with unnatural disasters fueled by denialism, inaction, and greed, and apathy. Both face enormous challenges, but there is hope when people on the frontlines act together [4].Arthur Golong: an LGBTQIA activist between local and globalArthur Golong was originally from Timex, one of the 14 zones of Barangay 88, San Jose district in  Tacloban City. A coastal community of 142 households and 170 families, Timex was one of the hardest-hit zones when the mega-storm Haiyan brought havoc to Eastern Visayas in November 2013. For the residents of Barangay 88, the question of survival was critical in the weeks after the disaster. While there was adequate influx of support from both local organizations and international communities, however, socio-political issues coupled with the growing demand for relief rendered the delivery of basic needs and services problematic. Arthur's proactive character has been most helpful in addressing this issue of getting relief to those who needed it. As she was known to be an active community member, humanitarian agencies desiring to come to the aid of her village were often referred to her to facilitate their entry. She recalls how she, dressed in a miniskirt, met Hilary Clinton who had come to ask the residents how they were doing after the typhoon [1].  Eight months after the disaster, Arthur and her family were among those who transferred to the government-constructed transitional shelters in Duplex 1, New Kawayan. They were not allowed to go back to their old neighbourhood because it had been identified under the no-build-zone policy, which prohibits the construction of any structure 40 meters from the coastline. Thus, they could not rebuild their home there. The transitional site is 17 kilometres from the city center. When the displaced were moved in, it lacked a potable water source and had yet to be energized. Livelihood opportunities were scarce. After Haiyan, my life changed. We lost our home and everything in it. My siblings who had their own families also lost their homes and other possessions. My sister-in-law who was pregnant also died. Since I was the one staying with my parents, I had to build a makeshift house before we were transferred to a transitional resettlement site. In that site, I was considered a leader [11]. Uprooted from all things familiar, the first 149 households that were relocated in the transitional site seemed to exist in a limbo. A month later, Arthur moved in with his parents. ""When I arrived there, there were only two organizations we relied on. [...] The officers seemed lost. Some of the residents found work in the city. The rest would just wait for what help arrives,"" she said. [1] Someone had to take charge. And so Arthur did. Sanctioned by the elected community president who recognized her leadership, Arthur started presiding community meetings and representing Duplex 1 in public hearings, supposedly, to address economic and living conditions issues in their community. She organized night watch groups to address security concerns, systematized the operations of community facilities and planned village activities where new neighbours can get to know each other and become friends. A true leader, she would be the first to pick up a spade to make drainage ditches or haul stones to cover the muddy path between houses. Transitional site management has proven to be a challenging subject in disaster response. Conditions in transitional communities are rather unstable and especially fluid, adding an onerous burden to community leaders there seeking government response to the people's needs for basic services. Arthur was often nominated to speak for the Haiyan survivors, especially in official public hearings and consultations. But she affirms: Despite being in this position, I still experienced different forms of discrimination. In disaster risk reduction management practices, I noticed that rescuers put gays as among the last to be rescued. Even in trainings for residents in transitional resettlement sites, the gays were considered the laughingstock. But I and two gay men really wanted to learn precisely because we would like to rescue gays who might be in situations of crisis [11]. Climate activists take on fossil fuel companies Arthur's story is a clear example of those global human voices committed to the struggle against climate catastrophe. In fact, Arthur was one of the witnesses called to testify in the Climate Change and Human Rights Inquiry, testifying climate change's impacts on Filipinos and especially focusing on how climate change compounds existing social issues like gender-based discrimination. In 2016, a group of Filipino campaigners joined environmental organisation Greenpeace in asking the Philippines' commission on Human Rights (CHR) to investigate the responsibility of major fossil fuel companies for the impacts of climate change on the human rights of the Filipino people, considering Typhoon Haiyan [2]. The Climate Change and Human Rights Inquiry in the Philippines turned into the world's first investigation into corporate responsibility for the climate crisis. The Commission called for a probe into the possible human rights violations of the 47 biggest fossil fuel and cement companies (""Carbon Majors"") resulting from climate change [6]. The hearing in which Arthur had a central role with her testimony took place in August 2018.The event was part of a landmark inquiry linking the actions of fossil fuel companies, and their contribution to climate change, to the resulting natural disasters and their impact on people's human rights [2]. Arthur spoke about the devastating Typhoon Haiyan that struck the Philippines in 2013 and how she spent hours after the storm clutching a tree trunk in floodwaters to survive, losing her home and possessions in the meantime. She also talked about the discrimination the LGBTQIA community faced in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, with the distribution of aid prioritizing heteronormative families. The CHR's national inquiry has clearly shown that people affected by climate change and whose human rights have been dramatically harmed must have access to remedies, and access to justice. Simply put, the Carbon Majors and other corporations have responsibilities to protect human rights as we face the climate emergency. The petitioners and climate advocates around the world are awaiting the outcome of the landmark inquiry in 2020 [6]. Even if the case is unsuccessful, the process of hearing from experts and people affected by climate change and amplifying their stories to a global audience – from Tacloban City to Manila, New York and London – will be incredibly powerful [2]. Filipinos from various walks of life and parts of the country – farmers, fisherfolk, transport workers, students, community leaders, Indigenous Peoples – took to the stand and shared their experiences of super typhoons and slow-onset climate impacts. They narrated how these have caused them and their loved ones more suffering daily. Their testimonies also show how climate change compounds existing social issues and increases the risks for the most vulnerable sectors [6]. To date, none of the respondent companies to the petition have made an appearance or acknowledged the jurisdiction of the commission to investigate the complaint. Shell's management told shareholders at its annual general meeting last year that the company did not consider the national inquiry to be the correct forum to discuss climate change issues [2]. Fossil fuel companies need to start seeing communities affected by climate change as a key stakeholder group in human rights due diligence. If fossil fuel companies do not act rapidly, we can only expect a world in which human rights are severely affected, and more people like Arthur will have no other avenue than turning against fossil fuel companies to seek remedy for the harm suffered [2].",post-disaster-typhoon-yolanda-recovery-process-fossil-fuels-climate-change-conflict,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"VALEC is a state enterprise connected to the Ministry of Transports in Brazil. They're building the Ferrovia de Integracão Oeste-Leste (FIOL). The railway is approximately 1500km long, connecting the States of Bahia and Tocantins. The construction process has started in 2011 and the final project's delivery estimated time was 2014. The idea is to drain iron ore production for export  through Ilhéus port. Due to the complexity associated with the logistic complex and a combination of several environmental licence processes to make to project happen (private and public ports, mine, and railway), it has been facing challenges to ramp up into operation.It is relevant to state that this project is connected to another one, Pedra de Ferro Mine, managed by BAMIN and also generating several conflicts with the nearby communities.One of the social impacts of the project is the expropriation of families. In July 2011, the first 100 families received indemnifications to leave their homes so the project could advance with construction in these areas.On top of that, Brazilian environmental agency (IBAMA) has interrupted later on that year the project's installation licence due to corruption investigation processes. The railway project is composed of three stretches: (1) From Ilhéus (BA) to Caetité (BA), encompassing 537km; (2) from  Caetité (BA) to Barreiras (BA), encompassing 485km; and (3) from Barreiras (BA) to Figueirópolis (TO), encompassing 505km, approximately. Each stretch has several different consortia in charge and the implementation rates are different along the railway project.Comissão Pastoral da Terra  (CPT) indicated conflicts due to this project are mostly connected to land (12 conflicts registered) and water (18 conflicts registered) issues. They are happening along the railway construction, encompassing different villages and municipalities and involving traditional communities (indigenous peoples and afrodescendants communities named ""quilombolas""), workers and nearby residents. The main impacts are connected to housing damages due the railway construction, the way the resettlement of communities was done, and changes in the river courses.In 2015 CPT coordinated an event aimed at information and experience exchange among the impacted communities. The objective was to improve the awareness among the affected people about the project issues in a systemic way, so they could be able to perform mobilization and network building processes and then confront the project with greater positive outcomes possibilities.In the same year, some of the railways stretch construction sites were stopped, and in Caetité (BA) the stoppage lasted more than two years. Other stretches are also facing delays.In 2016 VALEC reviewed their expropriation rules and the updated version is now on course in place of the previous one (dated from 2010).In March 2017 the public prosecutor officer in charge visited quilombola communities in Bom Jesus da Lapa (BA). During the meeting water issues, conflicts with FIOL's project, and mobility issues in roads nearby the construction sites were reported by community leaders.In June  2017 VALEC was cited in investigating cases of corruption in Brazil. Later on, in Agust, president Temer started negotiations with Chinese investors to continue FIOL's project.In the same year, the nearby communities in Brejinho das Ametistas (BA) together with MAM, CPT and the rural union have done a popular consultation with more than 100 people to discuss the impacts caused by VALEC and positioned themselves against the project.",valec-brazil,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Gawadar port is a small town near the Iranian border on Arabian sea in strategice Persian Gulf. Due to climate change and persistent drought in the region there is shortage of water supply which was further escalated after arrival of many workers from China and other parts of Pakistan, when it became part of China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Where the port has been leased by Pakistan to China for 40 years, the extreme shortage of drinking water supply has caused protest in the town.Water comes from Mirani dam to Gwadar. The Mirani dam is in Kech District in Balochistan province in the Central Makran Range. It has itself  a history when it was created against desires of the proposal of residents in 2001.On the night between June 26 & 27, 2007 the backflow water from Mirani dam inundated upstream areas destroying several thousand houses, and indigenous underground irrigation channels, displacing thousands of people, which were not compensated for. Water is transported by oil tankers to Gwadar which is hazardous for health. These water tankers belongs to private companies and they supply water to residents. These water suppliers have become in itself a mafia and sell water more than normal rate.  Many new dams have been constructed on Makran but due to shortage of rainfall it is not a viable solution. Residents of the area are struggling to find a drop of water.This has caused spordic protests all around Gwadar. Last November 2017 protestors went to Karachi city where they protested in front of Karachi press club and later blocked the main Syed Hashmi Avenue putting whole city at stand still at the time when prime minister Pakistan was visiting Gawadar for inauguration (1). The aim  for Gwadar to become a regional commercial, industrial and shipping hub, as part of the ambitious China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. For over a decade, Pakistani officials have dreamed of transforming the small but strategically located fishing port of Gwadar into a duty-free port and free economic zone – Pakistan's answer to Dubai.  The corridor is designed to give China a shorter, more secure trading route, via Pakistan, to the Middle East and beyond, while also boosting Pakistan's economy. However, as the press reports (1) (2) Gwadar resembles Dubai ""mainly in one respect – it doesn't have much water"". ""It hasn't rained here for the last three years,"" explains a local journalist, Sajid Baloch. (2). Abdul Rahim, who works for the Gwadar Development Authority, under the provincial government of Balochistan, said climate change is playing a role in Gwadar's thirst. Nearby Akra Kaur reservoir dried up two years ago, and water must now be brought from a more distant source, he said. Some of the water coming in is contaminated, leading to an increase in waterborne illnesses such as hepatitis, he added. Tapping groundwater isn't a solution. ""There is no point in digging wells as the underground water is all brackish,"" Rahim said.(2).  Muhammad Ali Kakar, the province's planning and development secretary, told a government committee in December 2017 that the total demand for water in Gwadar city was 6.5 million gallons a day, but tankers supplied only 2 million gallons.(2). To help solve the water shortages two desalination plants have been built in the port, with Chinese expertise. The smaller can provide 200,000 gallons of potable water per day to the port, while the larger one, recently completed in the adjacent duty-free zone, can supply double that amount. Both plants rely on power from generators, as there is not enough grid power in Gwadar to run them, said Sajjd H. Baloch, the director general of Gwadar Development Authority. Some fishermen say they now buy clean drinking water from the port, paying up to 50 Pakistani rupees (around $0.40) for a three-litre can. Gul Mohammed, the operations director for the port authority, said his agency was willing to supply clean water outside the port and duty-free zone, but would need to be paid to produce it. ""We are willing to provide water from the larger plant to the city of Gwadar at the rate of 0.98 rupees per gallon, but the Government of Balochistan has to sign an agreement with us,"" he said. The provincial government is reluctant to accept the offer, hoping for rains this year to fill the Akra Kaur dam, Rahim said.(2).  The Pakistani army, tasked with protecting the CPEC project (China Pakistan Corridor) meanwhile, also has laid the foundation for a large desalination plant to be built with help from the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland.The plant, to be completed by July 2018  will provide 4.4 million gallons of water a day, free of cost, to the inhabitants of Gwadar city, according to an army press release. Providing better services, including clean drinking water, is seen as a way of helping win local support for the development push – and to help quell an ongoing insurgency by Baloch separatists in the province. A new road will soon connect the port to the Makran Coastal Highway, which links Gwadar to Karachi. Gwadar's new airport will be Pakistan's largest when it is complete. The China Power Company also plans to open a 300 megawatt coal-fired power plant around 20km (12 miles) from the port to provide electricity to Gwadar. Meanwhile, tourism has started too, and the port is increasingly bustling with visitors.(2) To sum up (3), water management  in Gwadar, a port city on the southwestern coast of Balochistan, has turned into a severe challenge for local and national authorities. Citizens have taken to the streets to protest both against the water crisis and the authorities that have failed to pay the tanker companies which have been providing water to the city for the past months. Indeed, the city has struggled with a seemingly unending water crisis since May 2017. This crisis is bound to get worse as Gwadar's annual population growth rate of nearly 3 percent is expected to balloon once port companies start hiring. Meanwhile, the government has not yet not found a sustainable solution to the water issue, rather it has been paying tanker companies to truck in water from Meerani Dam in the neighboring district of Kech around 150 kilometers away from Gwadar city, at the cost of Rs. 17,000 (about $254.74) for each tanker.(3) This tanker-mafia — as most citizens call it — has benefited enormously from the water shortage. The contractors have repeatedly stopped supplying water over payment disputes holding  the citizens of Gwadar de-facto hostage, forcing the citizens to take to the streets. Struggles and protests over water are not new in Balochistan, but the repeated standoffs in Gwadar have become a major flashpoint amid rising tensions accentuated by ineffective governance, as well as growing poverty and inequality. This has now become an almost everyday story where the government stops payments for a time and in response the tanker-mafia announces a strike, which in turn triggers a citizens protest. (3). Part of the problem is that the government has so far not come up with an effective solution to the  ongoing water crisis. During the last 20 years, Ankara Kaur Dam was the main source of water for the city but recently it dried up completely because of low rainfall and a massive build-up of silt.(3).  With federal and Chinese funding, three new dams were completed in the last two years: Sawad, Shadi Kaur and Belar. But none have been connected to the city through pipeline systems so far.  Desalination plants could be a more long-term solution.  Water-tankers remain the only solution for now and while there is no shortage of funding, there is clear lack of interest in permanently solving this ongoing issue. In other words, if the scarcity of water is driven by lack of water, it is equally driven by lack of effective governance and money making (3).",shortage-of-water-in-gawadar,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA

"Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) together with Mumias Sugar Company Ltd (MSCL) came into an agreement to undertake sugarcane growing and ethanol production in the Tana Delta on 20,000 ha of the 40,000 ha land owned by TARDA. An EIA study was done for the project but it received major opposition from environmentalists. Nevertheless an EIA license was given in June 2008. A court case put an injunction on this project, but the case was thrown out on a technicality in June 2009. While the court injunction was still in force, in April 2009, TARDA were given a title for 40,000 ha of land in Tana Delta, on which the authority decided to grow maize and rice because Kenya was facing a food emergency as a result of the drought. Local communities including farmers and pastoralists were evicted from the area to give way for the agricultural developments. In August 2010, a new court case was filed by representatives of Tana Delta local communities in the Kenyan High Court. A first hearing was held though no injunction was granted due to the need for amendment and wide advertisement before the consideration of the request for such an order. The court case was widely covered in the Kenyan media and a court hearing to consider the injunction was scheduled for December 2010. The case has been postponed severally since then and is scheduled for hearing in mid September 2012. Plans were  still under way to implement the sugar project by TARDA and MSCL but a court decision in 2013 stopped the project. The Tana River Delta is one of the most important wetlands in Africa.

"In the wake of the 2011 revolution, persistent energy shortages prompted President Morsi to overturn a long-standing ban on coal imports for the cement industry in July 2013. The cement industry enjoys a large lobbying power in Egypt was successfully able to claim high losses, pushing to advance the coal agenda. Thus, in 2015, under current President al-Sisi, the country's environmental law was formally changed to allow the use of coal by heavy industry, and to permit coal-fired electricity generation (1). The law was also amended to eliminate a blanket ban on the use of coal and heavy fuels in residential areas. While officials are quick to point to various 'advantages' of coal use notably in cement plants, environmentalists argue that the use of coal as energy would be catastrophic for Egypt, which already has one of the worst pollution levels in the world (4). The cement industry's record on pollution has been dismal The imposition and enforcement of penalties for violations has been weak. Some fines are so small that cement companies find it cheaper to violate the law than to reduce harmful emissions (2).Further, pollution during transport is a risk as many lorries fail to prevent coal spewing into the air by covering the loads with canvas. Power plants consume vast amounts of water, mainly fresh, as a coolant. Its discharge into the sea raises water temperatures, endangering coral reefs. The dust from the coal will also put the reefs in danger. Finally, the risk to Egyptians' health are huge. A study published by now-removed Minister Laila Iskander, estimated that using coal in the cement industry would come with a US$3.9 billion annual health bill, and that one coal-fired power plant would raise this figure to $5.9 billion on a yearly basis. The study has since been taken down from the ministry's website. By 2013, an anti-coal movement composed of academics, doctors and environmentalists had coalesced around the Egyptians Against Coal (EAC) Facebook page and movement (1), a movement of academics, doctors and environmentalists. ""The first thing we did was share the photo of Lafarge's illegal shipment of coal in Alexandria port,"" explained Sarah Rifaat, Arab World coordinator for environmental NGO 350.org and one of EAC's founding members.(6). The NGO 350.org is concerned abut climate change.The campaign's objective was to raise awareness of the health and environmental threats associated with coal and to prevent coal from becoming a normalized source of energy in Egypt. Within months, the group garnered an increasing amount of attention online, organized meetings with affected local communities, cement industry representatives and government officials, held workshops and press conferences, and filed a court case against the April 2015 amendments to Egypt's environmental law.A joint statement released by several rights and environmental groups in 2014 accused the government of giving in to pressure by cement factories while turning a blind eye to the disastrous impact of coal on Egypt and its citizens, stating that ""Coal affects the brain, the nerves, the lungs, and the blood. Research proved that inhaling coal dust causes redox reactions and increases chances of lung cancer, blood viscosity, and narrowed blood vessels."" All these effects, the statement explained, are the result of being around coal, and before even starting the process of burning it to generate power. In a surprising turn of events in February this year, it was announced that all coal-fired power plant projects would be put on hold for the next five years. This postponement is assumed to be partly the result of the devaluation of the Egyptian currency, which doubled the price for new coal projects. A new Siemens gas-powered mega project creating a surplus in electricity generation and the discovery of the supergiant ""Zohr"" gas field in Mediterranean waters in 2015 could have also played a part in the government's decision to delay planned coal-fired power plants.(1) (6).",campaign-against-coal-egypt,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The recent oil spillage that occurred in River Ethiope that stretches through Ibada, Adagbrassa, Eko, Egbeku, Ogegere, Okuesajere, and Okuenenemuru villages of Ovwore community near Amukpe in Sapele Local Government area of Delta State, has been described as the worse oil spillage that has ever occurred in the community in recent times. The Oil Spil was caused by pippeline leakage belonging to NNPC/PPMC. For over three months , affected communities have suffered, as their major domestic source of water supply for fishing, drinking,cooking and washing has been polluted. Over 500 fish ponds,over 2000 raffia palm tress and other livestock have been destroyed by the oil spillage. About 20,000 people from the most affected villages of Adagbrassa, Eko and Ogegere have relocated from Ovwore community in search for survival.

"Due to its geographical position (a narrow strip of land between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that allows for its interconnection, and a transit zone between Central America and North America), the Isthmus of Tehuantepec has long been considered one of the most strategic territories in the Mesoamerican region. Since the 1970s, there have been development plans for this region, leading to the Integral Development Project of the Isthmus (PDII) in the late 1990s, followed by the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP), and its current version, the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project (PIDM). In addition to infrastructure development perspectives crucial for the transportation of goods, the isthmus also appears as a strategic area due to the richness of its natural resources. One of the natural resources that has sparked the most interest from transnational companies is the great wind potential offered by the southern part of the isthmus, due to the existence of a wind corridor between the high pressures of the Gulf of Mexico and the low pressures of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It is considered that this region has a potential capacity of 44,000 MW of wind energy, with 33,200 MW suitable for commercial development. The territory comprises traditional lands of the Binnizá and Ikjoots groups (Zapotec and Huaves in Spanish), most of whom are organized through communal land regimes and customary law. The indigenous communities in the area largely depend on traditional livelihoods rooted in the territory, including fishing and agricultural activities. The isthmus is also part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and one of the largest migratory bird routes, making it a sensitive and controversial area for the location of wind turbines. This great potential for wind energy generation has been utilized for the development of wind farms since 1994, with the installation of a pilot park by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) that served as a test for subsequent private investment in the construction and operation of new parks. As of early 2021, the Wind Corridor in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec comprises 29 private wind farms in operation, reaching an accumulated installed capacity of 2,709 MW. There is an oligopoly among the generating companies, as only 5 companies (Electricity of France - EDF, Acciona, Femsa, Iberdrola, and Enel Green Power) control 77% of the total installed capacity of the operating parks in the Isthmus. The majority of these projects have self-supply contracts, meaning they are intended to exclusively supply electrical energy to private companies that operate as partners of the wind parks. 74% of the electricity currently generated in the isthmus supplies highly polluting companies such as mining and cement companies (Grupo México, Peñoles, ArcelorMittal, and Cemex) or agro-industrial production and commercialization chains (Femsa, Chedraui, Soriana, and Wal-Mart), casting doubt on the purported ""clean energy"" and ""public utility"" always associated with these projects to promote them. Local concerns about the wind parks in the Isthmus began with the territorial allocation for private wind parks and the initial construction of projects. Local opposition was articulated through existing organizations along with the creation of new dialogue spaces, including well-established decision-making institutions (community and ejidal assemblies), social organizations, and emerging movements against particular wind energy projects. These efforts were further reinforced through broader resistance networks, such as the Assembly in Defense of the Land and Territory of the Indigenous Peoples in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. External actors also supported through a series of events developed in the region. The main claims mobilized by the communities have been the following: Violation of the right to consultation: From the initial negotiations between companies and the government, indigenous communities lacked formal information and consultation. In 1995, the Tepeyac Human Rights Center began to demand full information about the projects; to which the government did not respond. Meanwhile, local communities began to realize how private companies planned wind parks in their territories, offering low amounts of money for land lease contracts. In this sense, the opposition groups raised clear demands to stop all projects and permits until formal consultations are carried out; to ban any project where there are agrarian and territorial conflicts; to socialize access to information about the context, impacts, and risks related to the projects; and to respect any decision by local communities regarding the projects. Illegal and unfair lease contracts: After the allocation of polygons by the government and the companies, negotiations with the owners were signed through confusing processes, leading to legal disputes. In the particular case of the isthmus, there is confusion about the state of land ownership combined with long historical struggles to restore communal territories to indigenous communities. In this context, 126 legal claims were filed by the commoners to annul land lease contracts with foreign companies. In such cases, the communities argued that the companies provided unclear information about the characteristics of the projects, manipulated and falsified negotiation processes, and corrupted local and communal authorities. Several projects were delayed; the companies offered economic compensations, but most claimants refused to accept them. Although some contracts were canceled outside of the courts, the legal claims were never formally processed. Most contracts were maintained, granting 30 to 60 years of land use and access rights to private companies, retaining a large portion of the wind energy production revenue. Against land dispossession and privatization: ""Land dispossession"" has been a notion recurrently used by indigenous communities who consider the Wind Corridor as an expression of ""neocolonialism."" Therefore, land issues not only emerged in terms of lease contracts. Communities have asserted that the installation of wind turbines will lead to the disruption of the territory, local economies, and social identities. Bettina Cruz, a prominent indigenous leader of the Assembly, has insisted that they are not against wind energy, but against land grabbing and its impacts on local communities. Environmental impacts include biodiversity loss, water and soil contamination by lubricants, and reduced hydrological connectivity due to the change in the use of lagoons. Interoceanic Isthmus Wind Corridor Project: a new wave of land dispossession and expansion of wind parks? The Interoceanic Isthmus Wind Corridor, promoted by the current government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is a megaproject for the production and transportation of goods between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, through the establishment of industrial parks, maquiladoras along the isthmus, within a Tax-Free Zone, new infrastructure freight transport by railway, port, airport, or gas pipelines. The possible installation of industrial parks could dramatically increase the demand for electricity in the region and cause a new wave in the expansion of wind parks to meet those private interests. The interoceanic corridor represents a continuation of the process started 20 years ago by the wind companies. Promising a supposed development for the communities in the region by transforming them into land rent-seekers and cheap labor for the maquiladoras, generating community division, repression, and pollution. Nevertheless, the peoples of the isthmus continue to resist once again facing this new threat and organizing to defend their territories and ways of life.",corredor-eolico-en-el-istmo-de-tehuantepec-oaxaca,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"Italy started its nuclear power program in the early 60s and closed it in 1987, when a referendum decided to close all the national nuclear power plants (some attempts made by the Government to complete the construction of the Montalto di Castro plant were stopped by a Parliamentary Motion on June 12, 1990). The Italian Government, while building its power plants, promoted agreements with other countries with the aim to send and reprocess the radioactive waste abroad. The Government's Decree law no. 314 of November 13, 2003 [1] decided to locate the storage facility for the 2' and 3' categories (1.e. medium-high radioactivity) nuclear waste in the area of Scanzano Jonico. This decision was taken by-passing some fundamental steps like the site's technical qualification and public consultation, so it caused a conflict that soon spread and intensified. The Decree law 314 located this sort of nuclear dump under the soil of Terzo Cavone coastal locality, which is situated a few meters above the sea level. The same area is classified as a medium-high seismicity zone. The area was immediately decreed a ""military site of national security"" and its management, besides transport and storage operations, was entrusted to SOGIN: a national company born in 1999 with the task of looking after the dismantling of the nuclear power plants and the radioactive waste storage. In 2003 the SOGIN company was directed by a former army general: Carlo Jean. Land expropriations and militarization of the area were planned to enforce the decree. The town of Scanzano Jonico has about 7,000 inhabitants, but many more people, coming from the neighbouring municipalities, joined the protests since its beginning. Than thousands of people from the Calabria Region and all over the Basilicata Region, plus some national social associations and political organizations (mostly left-wing) joined the protest too. From the 13th to the 27th November 2003 many initiatives were organized against the Decree and the protests became famous as ""The 15 days of Scanzano Jonico"" or ""The Scanzano days"". On the 13th of November the defence of the territory began with the occupation of the national street ""106 Jonica"". The following day the committee ""ScanZiamo le Scorie"" was created. The mobilization was carried on with land occupations, demonstrations and cultural initiatives (such as an exhibition of local food products ). On the 13th of November, the President of the Basilicata Region and the town's Mayor filed an appeal to the Constitutional court against the Decree. After 15 days of civil protest, the Parliament while converting the Decree law 314 into the Law n.368/2003 (see {3}), cancelled the plan to build the waste storage in Scanzano Jonico, and postponed the localization of the Italian nuclear dump and the nomination of a Commissioner. This historic experience, together with the similar protest against the Montalto di Castro nuclear power plant, have contributed to creating an important precedent: the sentence n. 62/2005 of the Constitutional Court (see {4}) established the importance of people's consultation in projects that could affect environment and health. The Council Directive 2011/70/EURATOM (see {2}), at a later stage, established that every Country must locate its nuclear waste in a unique storage site. Italy in 2014 has not yet identified this site. With this aim, it has established via Legislative Decree n. 45/2014 (see {5}) the ISIN (i.e. the Nuclear Inspectorate), which is to evaluate, by 2015, the list of potential sites, to be reviewed by SOGIN using the paramaters of ISPRA (Superior Institute for Environmental Protection and Research) [6]. For this reason, the committee ScanZiamo le Scorie is still active in monitoring the government's initiatives and making people aware of radioactive waste and renewable energy, and building an anti-nuclear consciousness in Italy. While in 2014 almost all the irradiated fuel is still sent abroad, Italy continues to use some nuclear power plants and other facilities as temporary storage sites for about 30,000m3 of 1' and 2' categories (low-medium activity) radioactive waste. Italy is still hosting the Elk River (USA) nuclear power plant irradiated rods at the ENEA (Energy and Environment National Body) at the Trisaia facility, located near Scanzano Jonico. The total amount of Italian 2' and 3' categories radioactive waste to be laid down in the unique site is about 90,000m3.",nuclear-waste-storage-in-scanzano-jonico,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Ogbodo is one of the largest villages (in terms of population) in the Isiokpo Clan of Ikwere ethnic nationality in the Niger Delta. It is an agrarian community with rich swamps, which serve as hunting grounds for community members. Shell Petroleum Development Company (hereafter SPDC) discovered oil in commercial quantity in this community in the year 1972. Aged and rusty pipelines belonging to SPDC have resulted in frequent spills of oil into the Ogbodo environment. These have left the fragile ecosystem devastated and degraded. A major spill happened after a pipeline's burst on June 21th 2000. Even though the villagers alerted Shell the following day after the burst, the slow deployment and response by the company let the spill continue for 18 long days [1]. About 50,000 barrels of oil spilled [2]. The oil multinational employed a contractor to take care of the clean-up operations. The latter put on fire the spilled oil, sweeping away also the villagers' crops, canoes and fishing nets [1]. The locals suffered for days the fume from the burnt oil, affecting their health and worsening their living conditions already heavily affected by the spill. The terrible living condition of the locals have been reported by alternative media. Shell did not take well care of the situation. The locals were deprived from having access to any source of potable water and the water provisions by Shell were insufficient, whose ten drinking water plastic tanks (500-litre each) were refilled every three days. People were getting sick and Shell only sent one doctor working a few hours every day, but not on Sundays. It is women's daily life in particular that has been affected by the spill. As the traditional gendered division of labor allocates them the responsibilities to gather the seafood in the mangroves, make the palm oil, grow and collect the vegetables and medicinal herbs, all resources polluted or killed by the spill. In the medium and long-term it is women's social power and status that is being undermined [1]. Shell made false claims, accusing the locals of sabotage for having provoked the spill. By mid-July 2001, the local chiefs first refused Shell's food supplies until it did not revoke such false claim. The cause of the spill was investigated. It was determined that where the line burst and spilled it was buried six feet underground and it was old and rusty [3]. What is worth stressing is that the company conditioned its immediate help and support to the affected villages on whether the villages' chiefs accepted Shell's proposed Memorandum of Understanding. Shell insisted on providing its immediate support upon the condition that the chiefs accepted a compensation of 100.000 US dollars. That sum was considered ridiculous for a community of 150,000 people. The chiefs and the villagers were in no position to negotiate but yet they still denounced Shell's environmental racism, as they were aware of very different compensation conditions enjoyed in North America and Western Europe [4]. The very same day that Shell was presenting the Memorandum of Understanding to the chiefs, on July 14th2001, community's spokespersons made a public statement asking for help from human rights organizations. The role of women from Ogbodo has been crucial in building the bridges between the community and non-governmental organizations. They actively worked with the NGO Niger Delta Women for Justice, documenting the economic and health impacts on their community by Shell's spill [4]. Niger Delta Women for Justice and Friends of the Earth Nigeria drew from the experience of Ogbodo people, among many others, to lead a global campaign to render visible the so many human rights violations by Shell and other oil multinationals [4].Finally, six members of the Ogbodo community brought the case to court and negotiated the compensation amount outside of the court. ""Shell has agreed to pay the community an initial entry fee of 325,000 Nigerian naira, as well as N500,000 more for their legal expenses"" [3]. That amount corresponds to less than 2,030 US dollars. In the bigger frame, it is the whole Ikwerre peoples' traditional lifestyles that are drastically being affected and changing under the effects of oil drilling in their lands.

"The Ring of Fire refers to the massive planned chromite mining and smelting development project in the mineral-rich James Bay Lowlands of Northern Ontario, which is the ""third largest wetland in the world"" (Gov. of Ontario, n.d.). This is Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and Omushkego (Cree) territory (Leahy, 2014). Challenges facing the development of the Ring of Fire include lack of access to the remote region, infrastructure deficits such as roads, railway, electricity and broadband, First Nations land rights, and environmental issues (Rocha E. et al., 2013). In 2010 and 2011 several blockades were set up by Marten Falls and Webequie First Nations. The Ontario Government has been using divide and conquer tactics in attempts to weaken opposition by First Nations.The Ring of Fire has been considered ""one of the largest potential mineral reserves in Ontario"" with ""more than 35 junior and intermediate mining and exploration companies covering an area of about ""1.5 million hectares"" (Matawa FN, 2013).By 2010, there were more than 30,000 claim units in the 5,000-square-kilometre area (Canadian press, 2010). Tony Clement called the Ring of Fire ""the oil sands of Ontario"" (Tencer, D., 2013), with a potential of generating $120 billion (Matawa FN, 2013).Proponents claim the projects will ""create jobs and generate growth and long-term prosperity for northern Ontario and the nation"" (McKie, D., 2013).First Nation opposition to exploration activities is based on concerns regarding access roads, lack ofadequate consultation, lack of respect for previous agreements as well asenvironmental concerns including impacts to fish and caribou habitat.""The Ring is located in the heart of an irreplaceable environmental treasure. And over 24,000 First Nations people scattered in 34 small communities call these their ancestral lands. They depend on wild fish and animals for food and have inherent rights to the land. This wilderness of trees, wetlands, lakes and rivers is part of the planet's largest intact forest. It supports hundreds of plant, mammal and fish species, most in decline elsewhere, and is the continent's main nesting area for nearly 200 migratory birds.

"On the night of 6th September 2017 Hurricane Irma, the most powerful hurricane ever recorded over the Atlantic Ocean, an unprecedented Category 5, made landfall on the small Caribbean island of Barbuda. 185 miles-per-hour winds wreaked havoc. Land was flooded, homes were left without roofs and walls or completely flattened and the island's road, energy and communications infrastructure destroyed. Two days later all of Barbuda's 1,800 residents were forcibly evacuated, ferried to Antigua which only suffered minor damage.Two and a half months later only a small number of islanders were allowed to return, for a few hours at a time. Efforts to rebuild houses were piecemeal. People were patching up roofs using plywood and corrugated iron salvaged from the wreckage. Hardly anything had been done to re-establish essential services. Water and electricity supplies had not yet been restored; returned residents relied on generators and desalinated water provided by humanitarian aid organizations. Schools and the hospital remained closed. But bulldozers had been working day and night for weeks, flattening land in preparation for construction of a new airport.In a Channel 4 report Leslie Thomas QC said development of the airport is unlawful as it had not been approved by the Barbuda Council and consultation with the Barbudan people had not taken place. Work on the airport, which will have serious negative ecological impacts on the coral fringed island renowned for its seabird colonies, had commenced without the requisite Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Forest, wildlife habitats and land used for livestock grazing had been destroyed for the runway.Eroding Barbudans' land rights The chaotic after-effects of Hurricane Irma were exploited to attempt to erode Barbudans' land rights. Within days of the disaster Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne proposed that Barbudans returning to their homes buy freehold title deeds to their land for US$1, which could be used as collateral for bank loans to get mortgages to rebuild their homes, claiming that creating an ""ownership class"" would be ""empowering"". Barbudans objected that this would force them to buy land they have owned collectively for nearly two centuries, since 1834, when Britain abolished slavery in its colonies.Post-Irma disarray was being used to launch the latest in a series of attempts to undermine the 2007 Barbuda Land Act, which confirms that Barbudans share common title to the land and requires their consent for commercial development. The entire island is owned collectively and managed by an elected council. As co-owners citizens have rights to utilize the island's resources, including for grazing animals, hunting and fishing. Individual citizens, whether resident on the island or not, have the right to a plot of land for a house, to farm and for commercial enterprise. Liz Alden Wily, an independent land tenure specialist, refuted Browne's insistence that individual, private land ownership is a precondition for post-Irma recovery and the only way for Barbudans to secure bank loans for reconstructing their houses. Collective title is not a barrier to securing a mortgage. Another option would be for the government to follow successful examples of establishing forms of credit, such as a credit union, which would not place people's homes, often their main or only asset, at risk.The privatization agenda being pushed by Browne's government aims to enable developers to acquire land, in particular lucrative beach-front parcels, at low prices. In marked contrast with many Caribbean islands, including Antigua, where tourism revolves around all-inclusive beach resorts and cruise ship ports, tourism on Barbuda is small-scale. The vast majority of the coastline remains undeveloped, the beaches remain unspoiled. Residents have approved some tourism projects, maintaining a high degree of community ownership and control.Weakening the Barbuda Land Act would enable land purchase by Antiguan and foreign interests, to establish privately owned resorts. Browne admits that the airport will open up Barbuda for investors and is pushing for a cruise ship port on the island as well as an airport, to support tourism growth.On 12th December 2017, in a brazen attempt to subvert democracy, the first reading of the Barbuda Land (Amendment) Act took place in parliament. The Bill, seeking to repeal and replace the Barbuda Land Act and dismantle the communal tenure system, did not appear on parliament's agenda until moments before its introduction under an accelerated review process. Leslie Thomas said the act was tabled with no consultation whatsoever. Many Barbudans – returners to the island, the diasapora, and their supporters – moved to resist the land grab enabling legislation. Dozens of people joined a picket outside parliament and a petition against the Act has garnered 3,580 signatures.[1]The House of Representatives passed the repeal bill on 3rd May 2018 and it was passed to the Senate. Human Rights watch urged the government to consult with the people of Barbuda to determine the impact of repealing communal land ownership on their human rights, and to fully respect and safeguard those rights.[2] The Barbuda Silent No More movement was formed to strengthen islanders' voices as they work to protect communal land rights, determine their own future and conserve Barbuda's heritage, culture and environment.[3]John Mussington, a resident who refused to leave the island after Hurricane Irma struck because he suspected underhand motives for the evacuation, and filmed bulldozing of land for the new airport, reported that a huge area of land was being cleared and parceled up, saying it is clear that what is taking shape is not just an airport. He said the ""attack on our land tenure system is unconscionable"" and that the ""powers that be"" want Barbudans out of the way with the intention of a creating a ""private island"" for the enrichment of real estate speculators.[4]Application for judicial reviewOn 9th July 2018 a group of Barbudans, represented by Leslie Thomas QC, filed an application for leave for judicial review of the Government's decision to construct the new airport, moving for immediate shut down of the development. The islanders sought to address failures by the government to meet critical requirements in development of the airport and failure to follow planning procedures. A strip of once virgin forest land at least 2,164 metres in length that had been used for grazing, farming and hunting and provided habitat for the rare red footed tortoise and the Barbudan Fallow Deer plus rare forest trees including the white sap tree, had been cleared. The following government departments were listed as defendants: Development Control Authority (DCA), Antigua and Barbuda Airports Authority (ABAA), The Attorney General of Antigua and Barbuda and the Barbuda Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs. The legal action revealed that the Department of the Environment (DoE) warned the government of environmental risks including significant gaps in the Environmental Impact Assessment which failed to properly assess archaeology, biodiversity, hydro-geological and geological aspects [5]. The injunction was granted on 2nd August 2018. The High Court instructed that all construction on the new airport must cease immediately [6]. Fears over the negative environmental impacts of the airport project were compounded by the abandonment of the initial area that was bulldozed after it was discovered that caves lay underneath [7]. Aerial footage shows the land cleared on the initial site along with construction of the airport runway on a new site immediately to the south [8]. The injunction was lifted on 11th September [9].On 18 September 2018 - John Mussington And Jacklyn Frank, filed a second application in the High Court for an interim injunction restraining any further work being carried out on the airport development until the final hearing. The first interim injunction was set aside on procedural grounds hence the High Court could hear the matter. The case was heard and decided on the 7th of February 2020. The issue of whether the applicants had legal standing to bring the application for judicial review was raised and the Judge in the High Court held that they had legal standing which was founded on Section 25(2)(a) of the Physical Planning Act which requires the DCA to give considerations to any representations made by any person regarding a proposed development. The Court decided the balance of convenience was in not granting the interim injunction hence refused the injunction [10].The applicants appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision refusing the injunction. The Antigua and Barbuda Airport Authority counter appealed challenging the Judges finding that the Applicants had legal standing to bring an application for judicial review of the DCA's decision to approve the development. The matter was heard and decision passed on the 29 April 2021. The Judge in the Supreme Court decided that the applicants did not have legal standing as they were merely citizens and do not have the required 'sufficient interest' in the matter as required by the Civil Procedure Rules, 2000. The Judge also upheld the High Courts decision to refuse the interim injunction thereby allowing the airport project to continue. The applicants filed a request for permission to appeal the judgement of the Supreme Court before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Permission to appeal was granted on the 19th of July 2022 and the matter is yet to be heard [11]. Concerns over Barbuda development strategyPrime Minister Gaston Browne expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of construction work in October 2018. But Barbuda residents who had been travelling to and from the island said that, at this time, work had actually stopped, claims which were supported by photographic evidence [10]. Following years of research in Barbuda through the Barbuda Research Complex, Rebecca Boger and Sophia Perdikaris wrote of their concerns over Prime Minister Gaston Browne attempts to 'mirror Antigua's development strategy in Barbuda'. After the hurricane the Antigua-based central government, which has jurisdiction over the Barbudan governing council, focused on tourism ventures rather than supporting local recovery. The new airport, constructed even though two existing airports remained functional after the storm, is intended to serve high-end tourist resorts. In addition to obliteration of forest, farming and hunting areas for the airport, mining for limestone used for airport construction resulted in destruction of a further 20 hectares of landscape and animal habitat [13].GLAN supports the legal struggleGlobal Legal Action Network (GLAN), an international non-profit organization that pursues innovative legal actions across borders, joined the fight against the new airport in March 2019. GLAN is supporting the legal struggle of the two Barbudans, John Mussington and Jacklyn Frank, who filed the injunction to halt the project, pending a judicial review, in 2018. Barbudans and their supporters have returned to court with new evidence and GLAN is seeking the public's assistance with the case through public pledges [14]. Barbudans are being represented on a pro-bono basis by leading barristers from Garden Court Chambers in the UK, who have expertise in environmental and human rights law, in association with Justice Chambers in Antigua, with GLAN providing legal and logistical support. GLAN launched a crowdfunder campaign to raise funds for what is expected to be 'a long legal battle ahead', pointing out that the case is 'symptomatic of a global trend where vulnerable communities are dispossessed of their land to make way for large-scale private investments from which governments, multinational corporations and investors seek to profit'. The crowdfunder also mentions the climate change impacts of the new airport 'to which Barbuda, a low-lying island, is particularly vulnerable' [15].",barbuda-new-airport,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Kasargod District is located in the southern part of India in Kerala State. This district is famous for its cashew plantation. Plantation Corporation of Kerala, a state government enterprise has cultivated cashew plant in the vast areas of this district. To protect this crop since the mid 1970s, the pesticide endosulfan has been widely used and aerially sprayed on cashew nut plantation covering several villages in the district [1]. The controversy for using the 'endosulfan' started emerging since the 1990s [2]. People residing in the villages near or within the plantation have felt that they are affected by different kinds of illnesses. Villagers also observed that unique kinds of illness have started emerging among human and animals which was never seen before. Rumors have started that the aerial spraying of endosulfan on cashew plantations is main cause of abnormal cases of many alignments for example; cancer, skin disease, congenital deformities, sterility and other illnesses [1]. The side-effects of pesticide spray in cashew plantations are not restricted only in that district rather it was spread into the neighboring districts Karnataka, adjacent to Kasaragod [4]. As time passed, local activist groups convinced that the illness was being caused by 'endosulfan' - a very old off-patent pesticide of the organochlorine class [2]. Environmentalists as well as the various groups formed Anti-Endosulfan Committee to form a pressure group to ban Endosulphan. According to an estimate by Anti-Endosulfan Committee about 8,000-9,000 persons in Kasaragod district are affected due to the spraying of endosulfan in the cashew plantations. About 500 persons have lost their lives over the past decade owing to various diseases triggered by the large-scale use of pesticides in the district [4]. The matter is highly controversial one and according to some reports what really happened in Kasargod is not very clear. Some studies tried to correlate the occurrence of illness due to the endosulphan poisoning and other claim that the disease occurrence is normal and cannot be correlated with the spraying as endosulphan decay fast in warm Indian climate. These kinds of illness may not be due to Endosulphan alone [2].UPDATE. There is an update to this case (while the origins ofthe case are reported in full in Sunita Narain's book of 2017).  On  31January 2018, The Hindu reported,  thata  leading social activist, Daya Bai,said that the Kerala government was ignoring the sufferings of mothers andchildren. This was when the victims of indiscriminate spraying of the pesticideEndosulfan in Kasaragod district staged an agitation in January 2018, demandingthat the State government implement the Supreme Court order issued in January2017 to disburse ₹5 lakh (less than 10,000 USD) as compensation to  victims on the ""official list"" within threemonths.",use-of-endosulphan-in-kasragod-kerala-india,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Rapid development in the 1950s caused a chronic shortage of drinking water. As populations grew in the city during the 1960's, two new wells were drilled along a industrial area in order to develop additional community water supply. Almost immediately, residents began to complain about the water, suspecting that it was responsible for the occurrence of childhood leukemia and the increase in birth defects. Ten years after the development, an analysis determined those wells were contaminated with trichloroethylene (highly carcinogen) and shut the wells down.Woburn, Massachusetts was the inspiration for the famous book and movie ""A Civil Action"", which documents the severe water contamination, subsequent health impacts in the community, and legal battle for restitution.  Wells G & H were two municipal groundwater wells developed in 1964 and 1967 to supplement the water supply of the city of Woburn.Despite warnings by an engineering study that the groundwater was too polluted and that well water would not be safe to drink, the town went ahead and drilled the new wells on the east bank of the Aberjona [1]. These wells would supply about 30 percent of the city's drinking water  The extensive contamination of groundwater cited in the engineering study was the result of decades of industrial water pollution. According to a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the groundwater was contaminated with industrial solvents, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Soil on the five properties was contaminated with VOCs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides. Sediments in the Aberjona River were contaminated with PAHs and heavy metals such as chromium, zinc, mercury and arsenic [2].  In fact, the safety of Woburn's drinking water had long been a contentious issue. Woburn had been home to industry for over 150 years. Tanneries used toxic compounds to cure leather, and other factories sent numerous toxic chemicals down the Aberjona River [1].  In 1973, a three and a half year old boy living in the area was diagnosed with leukemia.  He and seven other children died and many became seriously ill before any testing was done or any action was taken, despite residents complaining that the water smelled and tasted bad, and that it corroded the pipes. Furthermore, residents discovered that there were eight cases of leukemia in east Woburn over a 15 year period [3]. This was at a rate four times higher than the national average and the illness was concentrated among families that had drawn most heavily from the two polluted wells [1].  In 1979, several barrels of chemicals were found dumped near the Aberjona River and when state investigators tested Wells G and H, they found that they were contaminated with TCE and other industrial byproducts.The wells were immediately shut down and in 1982 the Wells G & H Superfund Site was placed on the National Priority List to receive federal money for cleanup [2]. At the same time, a formal complaint against W.R. Grace, Beatrice Foods (formerly Riley Tannery), and UniFirst was filed by several plaintiffs through Jan Schlichtmann, an  inexperienced lawyer.  The defendants denied that they had caused the pollution of the wells [4]. W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods were both huge corporations that owned the property where the pollution occurred.They also had very experienced and well-financed lawyers. During the trial, one of the defendants consistently perjured itself; the defense attorneys hid critical evidence of a secret clean-up of contaminated soil that would have strengthened Schlichtmann's argument; and the case was assigned to an allegedly biased judge who apparently hated  Schlichtmann and was friends with the leading defense attorney. To make it all worse, the jury agreed that there was not a ""preponderance of evidence"" that Beatrice Foods had polluted the wells and that only Grace was found responsible.  The judge, however, threw out the verdict against Grace on the grounds that the jury's written decision was confusing and contradictory.Schlichtmann settled with Grace for $8,000,000, providing the victims' families with several hundred thousand dollars each, but no admission of guilt, no apology, and no clean up [1]. Even though Schlichtmann had to settle out of court, the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took notice.  Declared a Superfund Site (under the CERCLA legislation), the EPA forced Grace and Beatrice as the owners of the property to pay for the nation's most expensive toxic cleanup, with cost well over $68 million USD [1]. More than 30 years after the landmark court case, the wells that supplied toxic drinking water and a legacy of cancer to Woburn remain contaminated despite decades of cleanup efforts.  As of 2011, W.R. Grace ranks as the second biggest polluter in Massachusetts [5].  One reporter summed up the lesson that can be learned from this case: ""The ugly truth is that the damage we do today will take a long time to fix"" [6].",water-contamination-from-chemical-companies,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The construction of a pulp and paper factory, Celulosa Aurauco S.A., using highly toxic chemicals next to the riverbed of the Cruces River, which is the essential water source for the whole valley and the nearby RAMSAR Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary, caused an immediate wave of protests from local communities and environmental associations, struggling to safeguard the Protected Areas extraordinary biodiversity. A report contracted by the Chilean government to the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia found that the companys pollution was responsible for rapid ecological change in the wetlands. The population of Black-necked Swans did not recover after 2004. An international commission with the World Wildlife Fund ratified the findings. Scientists on the pay of CELCO disputed the causality between the cellulose plant pollution and the swan population decline but the courts decision of July 2013 has clarified the facts. The Citizen Movement Action Group for the Swans, the Lonko Council of Pikunwijimapu, the Tralco Indigenous Community and the Steel Workers Trade Union Association of Valdivia filed lawsuits in 2004: one was a criminal investigation at the Prosecutor's Office in Valdivia and the other a legal petition to the Council of State Defence. In July 2013 a civil court in Valdivia found CELCO guilty for pollution in the River Cruces, events that had happened after the factory opened in 2004. Lucio Cuenca of OLCA said on 31 July 2013 that with this court decision, CELCO should close down the factory: ""Con este categórico fallo, Celco debería cerrar su proyecto"".

"The Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link is an immersed tunnel (in earlier design iterations, a bridge) that is proposed to connect the German island of Fehmarn with the Danish island of Lolland. This would cross over the Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea – 18 km (11 mi) wide – hence providing a direct link by railroad and highway between northern Germany and Lolland, and thence to the Danish island of Zealand. Denmark and Germany signed the state treaty on the construction of the link. The Transport Minister appointed Femern A/S to plan and design the fixed link across the Fehmarn-belt. Currently the EIA is being submitted for public consultation. It is also remarkable that the European Union has designated this project as one of the 30 prioritised transport infrastructure projects (TEN-T). Opponents have raised economical, environmental and social reasons to oppose the project. They say it is extremely expensive and that the traffic forecasts have been overestimated, hence provoking an underuse of the available infrastructure. In environmental terms it is noteworthy the potential bad effect than can be cause to the water exchange between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.

"On March 11, 2010 Environmental Rights Action (hereafter ERA), namely Friends of the Earth Nigeria's field monitors visited a site at Opolo-Epie, where Shell is constructing a gas flare. This trip took a course by Shell's Kolo Creek Logistic Base at Imiringi where gas flaring has been happening for many years. At Shell's Imiringi Flow Station the presence of the Military Joint Task Force prevented the monitors from going close to the facility. Pictures of the gas flare could only be safely taken from the confines of the car. The same happened at the new gas flare furnace site at Opolo-Epie, security concerns prevented the field monitors from getting too close to make their observations. At first, Shell was quick to tell the world that nothing of that sort was taking place. It actually came to pass that Shell flared gas at that very furnace (on completion) soon after ERA's observation and report. After repeated reports, Shell put off the flare and since then ERA's monitors and community folks have kept close watch on the site. Even though the Nigerian government has been shifting the deadline for gas flare stoppage in Nigeria because of oil companies influence, Shell completed the construction of a new gas flare furnace in Opolo-Epie, in the state of Yenagoa by 2010. By early 2011, ERA monitors visited the site. Recently some sand filling activities were observed around the gas flare furnace, linking directly with the Tombia/Amassoma Road. Community folks suspected the company might soon ignite the gas flare furnace again. Following a noticed glow in the skyline in Opolo and environs on the night of 29th July, 2011, steps were immediately taken to verify the situation and it was discovered that Shell had activated the furnace that same day. The flare was put off again after three days. This particular area is now a gas field. ERA has again been attracted to the site following the ignition of another gas flare furnace on Monday, 29th April, 2013. It is shocking to see that Shell is being permitted to construct a new gas flare furnace when they ought to be shutting down existing flare sites. This happens at a time when the rest of the world is concerned about climate change and proffering ways to curb it.""The Opolo-Epie plant is set to join at least 100 other flares burning across the swamps, creeks and forests of this oil-producing region, filling the atmosphere with toxins, seeding the clouds with acid rain and polluting the soil. Medical studies have shown the gas burners contribute to anaverage life expectancy in the Delta region of 43 years. The area also has Nigeria's highest infant mortality rate – 12% of newborns fail to see out their first year"" [1]. Oil multinationals like Shell, Exxon, Chevron and Agip give their own arguments to justify the practice of gas flaring: ""the absence of a domestic market, the imposition of price controls and the high cost of building infrastructure to capture and distribute natural gas have made it economically unviable for them to end flaring. They complain that they are forced to operate as minority partners in joint ventures with the NNPC, which consistently fails to provide its share of investment"" [1].

"A rise in the trade along the U.S- Mexico border, as a result of trade agreements and globalization has also led to a rise in pollution and environmental injustices. There are 66 documented toxic waste sites in the Mexican border states of which Tijuana ́s Metales y Derivados, a U.S.- owned maquiladora factory recycling batteries imported from the U.S. stands as one of the border's most visible symbols of an industrial threat to a community's environmental health [1]. The factory was constructed on the rim of Tijuana's Otay Mesa industrial park, 150 yards above Colonia Chilpancingo's 10,000 residents. Owned by San Diego-based New Frontier Trading Corporation, the plant began smelting in 1972 to recover lead and copper from automobile batteries and other sources. For over 20 years, residents expressed concerns to local and national officials about possible threats to public health and the environment. In 1987 and 1989, Mexican authorities ordered cleanups and imposed fines; however, the factory owners did not respond, and there was no enforcement. One 1990 study of the local creek found lead levels 3,000 times higher than U.S. standards, and cadmium 1,000 times higher [2]. In 1987 and again in 1989, Mexican authorities ordered cleanups and imposed fines; however, the factory owners did not respond, and there was no enforcement, the facility remained in operation until March 1994, when the Federal Ministry for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA ) ordered its closure for violating Mexico's environmental laws [3]. The owners fled to the United States, leaving approximately 24,000 tons of mixed hazardous waste behind, including over 7,000 tons of lead slag. With only a crumbling retaining wall, rusting drums, and the tattered remnants of plastic tarps to contain the wastes, the plant continued to leach arsenic, cadmium, antimony, and other hazardous metals into the soils and waters of the community below. Metales y Derivados landed on the international stage in October 1998, when San Diego's Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) and residents of Colonia Chilpancingo (the Padre Canyon Restoration Committee) filed a petition with the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), the principal institution of NAFTA's environmental ''side agreement.'' Chilpancingo's parents and activistsheld news conferences, organized vigils and protests, and launched letter writing and direct action campaigns—strategies familiar to EJ activists everywhere. The case gained a high profile in the debate over the lessons of NAFTA's shortcomings for the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas [4]. The community's campaign continued for several years. In February 2002, the NACEC released its factual record on the Metales case. The report confirmed the community's claim that the site presented grave risks to human health, and called for remediation [1]. The ruling offered vindication and a great symbolic achievement, but it was a hollow victory, given that the commission has no enforcement authority or budget. With no cleanup forthcoming, local homemakers and activists formed a new citizen's organization, the Colectivo Chilpancingo Pro Justicia Ambiental (Chilpancingo Environmental Justice Collective), in April 2002. The women of the Colectivo kept pressing PROFEPA for a cleanup. In May 2003, they increased the pressure by offering a cleanup plan of their own, calling on officials to seek implementation. In February 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its Mexican counterparts began to seek funding for a cleanup strategy. A month later, EHC and Colectivo members met with U.S., Mexican, and Baja Californian officials and established a working group to carry out cleanup and remediation (Cantlupe and Wilkie 2004).Finally, in June 2004, the Colectivo and the Mexican government signed an agreement for a comprehensive cleanup of the Metales y Derivados site within 5 years. Mexico's state and federal governments initially contributed $500,000, and the U.S. EPA $85,000 more, toward a cleanup expected to cost $5–10 million.In April 2005, the state of Baja California expropriated the site and assumed responsibility for remediation, and by the end of 2005, the bulk of the highest risk, above-ground hazardous waste had been removed (2,000 tons, plus 50 tons of lead smelter process equipment), and the EHC and the Colectivo had succeeded in archiving all of the waste-removal manifests [5]. By 2007, the cleanup reached the third phase of the working group's remediation plan and was completed in 2008 [3].According to Magdalena Cerda, EHC Organizer, ""the cleanup of Metales y Derivados is a huge victory for us. We hope it can inspire and guide other communities seeking solutions to environmental injustices like this one.""",chemical-hazard-conflict-over-the-metales-plant-at-otay-mesa-industrial-park-tijuana-mexico,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Greenpeace stated that ""Malaysia has become the world's rubbish bin"", reporting that in 2018 this country imported 754 tonnes of plastic waste from 19 countries. The town of Jenjarom, located in the Kuala Langat District, is now smothered in 17,000 tonnes (17mil kg) of waste [1].  Jenjarom's proximity to Port Klang - Malaysia's largest port and the entry point for most of the country's plastic imports - has made it the ideal location for the importing of rubbish. There are 33 illegal factories in Kuala Langat alone, the district where Jenjarom is located. A quick walk around the sites reveals that a staggering amount of plastic waste comes from foreign countries, with a huge portion of it from Japan and the UK - as brands like Asda, Co-op and Fairy can be seen strewn around. Illegal plants get rid of plastic waste in cheap but extremely dangerous ways - both for the environment and for people's health - by burying or burning it. The same phenomenon occurs in other Malaysian cities and islands - like Pulau Indah [6] - making Malaysia the ""rubbish bin"" of the West [6].Residents in Jenjarom started to become aware of the presence of these illegal plants during the summer of 2018, when the toxic fumes released by the factories caused an odd smell that came every night, making it impossible for residents to sleep well. Also, many residents around the area started suffering from the direct consequences of waste dumping, with their health and well-being being affected every day [1]. Local people reported respiratory diseases, like bad coughs; some also reported having coughed up blood clots. Children were also affected: they reported rashes all over their skin, and it became impossible to simply touch them because of the pain they suffered. An initially small group of Malaysian villagers from Jenjarom, aware of what was happening in their town, soon turned into environmental activists: they started filming at night the activities of the illegal factories; they hired a drone to shoot footage of the tonnes of rubbish and they collected evidence in order to make reports for the authorities, alerting the media and the government [4]. They set up the ""Kuala Langat Environmental Association"" in order to denounce and protest against the presence of the illegal waste recycling factories. Their charges led to the closing of many illegal recycling factories and the tightening of the governmental rules about waste imports. Even if the activists have reached some important objectives in order to solve the problem, one activist states that ""these illegal factories can be very sneaky. They will pop up again in more hidden locations, so we have to continuously hunt for them"" [4].Although the Malaysian government has shut down 33 factories, the 17,000 tonnes of rubbish left by these factories are still there - and this number is not insignificant for a town of 30,000 [3]. Most of this waste has been repossessed by the authorities, but a staggering 4,000 tonnes of waste plastic still sits on a single site - open to anyone who might walk by [5].",malaysia-plastic-pollution-jenjarom-malasya,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"Wanning is a county-level city in the southeast of Hainan Province, China. Although called a ""city"", Wanning refers to both the county seat and to the entire county as a whole. Tourism plays a vital role in the city. Famous for its tropical scenery, Wanning proper lies approximately half an hour's drive from the beach and has several five-star hotels. The city of Wanning produces coffee, black pepper, rubber, rice, bananas, and sugarcane. [1]As the amount of domestic waste generated in Wanning was continuously increasing, and was about to reach the maximum landfill capacity, the Wanning Government planned to construct a waste-to-energy plant firstly in the Shidun Branch of Changfeng Farm in Changfeng Town, where it's about 10 kilometers from the city center of Wanning, 4.5 kilometers from Changfeng Town, and 3.5 kilometers from National Expressway G223. The project was initiated in 2014-2015 and covers an area of about 115 mu (~7.6 ha), with a total investment of CNY 430.146 million (~ USD 60 million) and a daily capacity of 600 tons. The estimated annual power generation will be about 607.8 million kWh. [2] The Wanning City Government stated that after the completion of the project, there will be no more landfills in the city and its surroundings. This will not only fundamentally solve the problems caused by the use of valuable arable land, the surrounding odors, the soil and the groundwater contamination caused by the traditional landfills, but also completely eliminate random waste burning on the roadside which causes air pollution. [3]In February and March 2016, the local government organized experts on environmental protection and some representatives from villages to participate in the planning process of the project, however, it was not effective to address the concerns from the local residents. People were worried about the fact that the waste incineration plant was too close to a reservoir which serves as the drinking water source for the area, and it was also too close to the residential area. [2] Some other people, including immigrants from all over the country and locals, also worried about the potential impacts on the value of their properties. [4][5] The residents started their petition and protest at the Changfeng Township Government in April 2016. On April 25, hundreds of villagers from Changfeng Town held banners with the words ""Protecting reservoirs! Protecting water sources!"", shouting slogans, marching to the Wanning city Government, asking the government to stop the construction of the waste incineration plant. During the parade, there was a fierce conflict with the local police. Many people were injured in the conflict and 13 people were arrested. Later, in a meeting with some representative protestors, officials of Wanning City requested the masses to express their opinions ""through legitimate and reasonable channels"" and they promised that the public opinions would be heard and the procedures of constructing the waste-to-energy project would be strictly followed. In the meantime, the project was forced to be suspended. [2] [6]In November 2016, the project was resumed by the Wanning government and it was proposed to be relocated to Sangengluo Town, and invested and constructed by China Power Clean Energy Development Company Limited. On January 1, 2017, residents from Sangengluo Town also protested in front of the Wanning Government against the proposed waste incineration plant and there was a clash between the protestors and the police which led to injuries of 6 local residents and 8 policemen. [7]The next day after the clash, the work of a policeman who carried out violent enforcement during the clash was suspended. The Wanning City Government announced again that the waste-to-energy project was still in the stage of site survey and selection, and the final location would be decided in accordance with the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the consultation of the surrounding people. On January 3, 2017, Zhou Gaoming, Mayor of Wanning City, released a letter to the people of the city, giving a brief explanation of the location of the domestic waste incineration plant that everyone cares about and the location of Sangengluo Town has not been confirmed yet. On January 6, 2017, the Wanning City Government issued an official announcement again, saying that the government did not officially approve the site selection of the Waste-to-Energy Plant in the 19th Branch of Xinzhong Farm in Sangengluo Town, and according to requirement of the procedures, the siting and construction works should not be initiated without the consent of the local residents.

Construction is now in progress at the site in Makavarapalem in Visakhapatnam district though the construction of roads and other infrastructure for the mines remains incomplete due to significant local opposition. The surrounding villages remain within metres of the proposed site and its polluting activities. Another concern for local residents and Visakhapatnam city residents is the 38 million litres of water per day that has been allocated to AAL from the controversial Polavaram project (GVMC But Visakhapatnam city is already starved of water and since the Polavaram project is mired in litigation, it is not certain when, or if, there will be any water available at all. The people of Visakhapatnam district demand that the Andhra Pradesh government should not allow bauxite mining. An all-party committee opposing the mining called for the shutdown to protest Chief Minister N.

"(Español abajo) The conflict is related to the state-owned, Tel Aviv-based Mekorot Israeli National Water Company. In collaboration with the state of Israel, Mekorot, since its foundation in 1937, has restricted water supplies to Palestinian communities in order to supply Israeli settlers in what has been condemned as a water apartheid. Palestinians are charged higher rates for water than Israelis, even though much of this water comes from Palestinian territories. Furthermore, Mekorot has facilitated the illegal Israeli settlements by building water infrastructures that are essential to their development. The company is also accused of committing the international crime of pillaging natural resources in the occupied territories. The breach of the right to water violates Article 1[1] of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as several other human rights, such as the rights to health, adequate housing and food, to which water is essential, thus also violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the 64/292 UN GA Resolution recognizing the right to water and sanitation. Moreover, since Israel is an occupying power in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, the foregoing can also entail a crime of persecution and forced displacement, in breach of the IV Geneva Convention and the Statute of the International Criminal Court. History of the conflict Mekorot has been Israel's national water company since 1937, operating through its three subsidiaries (Mekorot Water, Mekorot Infrastructure and Mekorot Projects), which control all the water-related processes within the territory, from the water distribution and sales to the provision of the company's expertise abroad. Mekorot both profits from and facilitates many of the human rights violations that are perpetrated over the Palestinian population. Mekorot's activities have resulted in a highly unequal system of water management that further reinforce the different living standard between Israelis and Palestinians. For instance, Israel extracts every year an average of 461 MCM of water from the Mountain Aquifer underneath the West Bank. Palestinians on the other hand extract only on average 100 MCM a year from this same resource, with Mekorot supplying 75 MCM and 45 MCM coming directly from wells within the West Bank controlled by Israel or by settlers. This results in the daily water consumption per person in the OPT being 70 litres – well below the 100 litres per capita daily recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) – while Israeli daily per capita consumption is about 300 litres. Furthermore, the monopoly ran by Mekorot over the water infrastructure of Gaza and the West Bank (which was handed over to the company after the 1982 occupation for 1 NIS [1 NIS = .23€]) not only prevents Palestinians of accessing their own water, but also of denies their entitlement to a market source from which Mekorot now profits and hinders the agricultural potential of the population. The responsibility of Israel comes from the almost totality of the public contracts that runs with the company as well as from its promotion around the world, utilizing its bilateral ties with other countries to export the expertise obtained through the aforementioned violations. The role of the Architecture of Impunity The impunity of Mekorot is inevitably linked to the political development of the State of Israel and the international support it still maintains. The current status of the water legislation is still determined by Article 40 of the Oslo II accords (1995), witnessed by representatives of the US, Russia, Egypt, Norway and the EU. The accords were originally intended to recognize undefined Palestinian water rights. However, they imposed severe restrictions on the development and maintenance of Palestinian water infra-structure and formalized an asymmetric Joint Water Committee (JWC) that, from the beginning, allocated a much greater portion of the aquifers to Israel. The World Bank issued, in 2009, an assessment of the results of the Oslo II accords, which, although initially expected to be revised after 5 years of its signing, were and are still in force. The report indeed proved that the new system not only did not reach the expectations (with half of the households claiming problems in the quality of the water and only 31% of the West Bank inhabitants connected to a sewerage network), but also water withdrawal per person has declined since then and the percentage of household income des-tined to water doubles the globally accepted standard. While the overall supply has increased, there is a greater (enforced) reliance on Mekorot. Proof of the difficulties of the Palestinians to develop their own water industry is the fact that the JWC has rejected most Palestinian-proposed projects, while all but one of the projects proposed by Israelis have been approved. What is worse is that, despite Oslo II enhancing an already unequal system, Mekorot has continued to even break the minimum requirements of the article. The fact that the water provisions stated at Oslo II have not been revised in 20 years portrays the little importance that international actors have given to the situation. Even the World Bank, despite the finding of the aforementioned report, is the main sponsor of the Red-Dead Sea Canal project, an agreement between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (although the President of the Palestinian Water Authority claims the agreement was essentially between the first two). The great majority of Palestinian NGOs requested a stop to all forms of cooperation and a public rejection to the project, as it continues to legitimize the water rights dispossession taking place in Pales-tine. The World Bank Inspection Panel that investigated the impact of the project for Palestinians considered the arguments of the resistance as legitimate, yet refused to act. Furthermore, a number of individual states have received ""exported expertise"" from Mekorot: Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bosnia, Canada, Cyprus, Greece, India, Malta, Mexico, Serbia, South Korea, United Kingdom and United States. Mekorot has also benefited from the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which provides Israel with preferential trade terms with the 27 EU countries. Particularly relevant is the EUR 120 million contract from the European Investment Bank which will be destined to a Mekorot subsidiary for the construction of a seawater desalination plant. Attempts of access to justice Aside from the well developed resistance to the occupation of the Palestinian territory, there has also been an organized strategy to oppose the activities of Mekorot in what relates to the water rights violations. As there is no possibility for a short or midterm remedy by the government of Israel, the affected community has had to look for the support of the international community to bring justice to their land. The campaign Stop Mekorot has thus designed a careful strategy of resistance, structured in four levels: community mobilizing; public advocacy; boycott, divestment and sanction campaigns; and lobbying and legal advocacy. Some of their actions have received international response. For instance, the Secretary-General of the UN included in his report to the 25th session of the Human Rights Council a condemnation of Mekorot's policies. The United Nations report of the independent international fact-finding mission on the implications of the Israeli settlements on the rights of the Palestinian people also condemned Mekorot. Furthermore, a French parliamentary report referred to these policies as water apartheid. The First International Week Against Mekorot was organized between March 22-30, 2014, with mobilizations taking place all around the world. Three major victories have come as the result of pressuring companies or countries not to do business with Mekorot. At the end of 2013, after a three-year long campaign, Argentinian activists succeeded in stopping a 170 million contract that would have had Mekorot build a water treatment plant in La Plata (Buenos Aires); again, at the end of 2013, the Dutch public water company Vitens cancelled a Memorandum of Understanding with Mekorot because cooperation with company ""cannot be separated from what the UN writes about the policy of Mekorot [...] towards the Palestinian territories and the settlements""; and in March 2014, the public water company EPAL in Lisbon (Portugal) announced that, after a high level campaign, it had ended a cooperation agreement with Mekorot before its expiry term. What Justice could do: a say from the PPT In a hearing that was held in Geneva in June 2014, the Permanent People's Tribunal (PPT) listened to the testimony of Abeer Al Butmeh, from Stop the Wall / Pengon. Considering the evidence brought before the judges by this witness, the Tribunal recognized the actions of the transnational corporation as another example of violations of human and people rights. In line with its full judgement of Madrid, in May 2010, and just a few months before the session that was held in Mexico in December 2014, the PPT underlined once again how transnational corporations, including Mekorot, systematically violate human and peoples' rights to their own profit. In the same line, the PPT recognized in this widespread practice the current shortcoming of international law, namely the impossibility of accessing justice and obtaining a remedy that is increasingly becoming an unbearable burden for affected communities, as well as for the laws that are supposed to give them shelter. In the same spirit, the PPT acknowledged the necessity to improve international legislation, including through a binding treaty on transnational corporations, and a Peoples' treaty, in order to hold transnational corporations accountable for their actions. Español Resumen del conflicto El conflicto está relacionado con la compañía nacional de agua de Israel, Mekorot. En colaboración con el Estado de Israel, Mekorot, desde su fundación en 1937, ha restringido el suministro de agua a las comunidades palestinas en beneficio de los colonos israelíes en lo que se ha considerado como un apartheid de agua. Los palestinos deben pagar tarifas más elevadas que los israelíes, a pesar de que la mayoría del agua proviene de territorios palestinos. Es más, Mekorot facilita la expansión y subsistencia de los asentamientos de Israel al construir una red de distribución del agua e infraestructura esencial para su desarrollo. La compañía también es acusada del crimen internacional de saqueo de recursos naturales en los territorios ocupados. La violación del derecho al agua quebranta el Artículo 11(1) del Pacto Internacional de Derecho Económico, Sociales, y Culturales, así como de muchos otros derechos humanos para los que la provisión del agua es fundamental, como el derecho a la salud, la vivienda, y a la comida. Esto supone, por tanto, una violación del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Políticos, de la Convención Internacional sobre la Eliminación de Todas las Formas de Discriminación Racial, del Convenio de Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos del Niño, y de la Resolución 64/292 de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas sobre derecho al agua y sanitarios. Por último, al ser Israel una potencia ocupante en Cisjordania, la franja de Gaza y Jerusalén, lo anterior también podría constituir un crimen de persecución y desplazamiento forzado, en violación de la Convención de Ginebra IV y del Estatuto de la Corte Penal Internacional. Historia del conflicto Mekorot ha sido la compañía nacional de agua de Israel desde 1937, operando a través de tres subsidiarias (Mekorot Water, Mekorot Infrastructure y Mekorot Projects), que controlan todos los procesos relacionados con el agua en el territorio, desde la distribución del agua y su venta a la exportación de tecnología. Mekorot se beneficia de y facilita las violaciones de derechos humanos perpetradas contra la población palestina. Las actividades de la compañía han implantado un sistema de gestión del agua altamente desigual, aumentando la diferencia en los niveles de vida entre israelíes y palestinos. Por ejemplo, Israel extrae cada año una media de 461 Mm3 de agua del Acuífero de la Montaña, en Cisjordania. Los palestinos, sin embargo, solo extraen una media de 100 Mm3 al año de la misma fuente, siendo 75 Mm3 de éstos suministrados por Mekorot y 45 Mm3 proveniente de pozos situados en Cisjordania controlados por israelíes o colonos. Esto produce que el consumo de agua medio por persona en los territorios ocupados sea de 70 litros – muy por debajo de los 100 litros por persona diarios recomendados por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) – mientras que el consumo diario medio para un israelí alcanza los 300 litros. Además, el monopolio de Mekorot sobre el agua de Gaza y Cisjordania (el cual fue entregado a la compañía tras la ocupación de 1982 por 1 NIS [1 NIS = 0,23€]) no solo impide a los palestinos el acceso a su propio agua, sino que también les niega su derecho a una fuente de mercado de la que Mekorot extrae los beneficios y obstruye el desarrollo de la agricultura en la zona. La responsabilidad sobre Israel proviene tanto de la casi totalidad de contratos públicos que mantiene con la compañía como de la promoción de ésta fuera de sus fronteras, utilizando sus contactos bilaterales con otros países para exportar el conocimiento obtenido a través de las anteriores violaciones. El papel de la Arquitectura de la Impunidad La impunidad de Mekorot está inevitablemente relacionada con el desarrollo político del Estado de Israel y el apoyo internacional que todavía mantiene. El actual estado de la legislación sobre el agua sigue determinado por el Artículo 40 de los Acuerdos de Oslo II (1995), firmados en presencia de representantes de EE.UU., Rusia, Egipto, Noruega y la U.E. Uno de los propósitos originales de los acuerdos era reconocer los derechos del agua no definidos de los palestinos. Sin embargo, acabaron imponiendo serias restricciones en el desarrollo y mantenimiento de la infraestructura del agua en Palestina y formalizaron un Comité Conjunto del Agua (JWC, en sus cifras en inglés) asimétrico que, desde el comienzo, asignó una porción mucho mayor de los acuíferos a Israel. El Banco Mundial publicó en 2009 una evaluación de los resultados de Oslo II, los cuales, a pesar de la intención inicial de revisarlos tras 5 años, seguían (y siguen) aún vigentes. El informe, en efecto, comprobó que el nuevo sistema no solo no alcanzó las expectativas (con la mitad de las viviendas alegando problemas en la calidad del agua y con solo un 31 % de los habitantes de Cisjordania conectados a un sistema de alcantarillado), sino que además la extracción de agua por persona ha descendido desde entonces y el porcentaje de ingresos por hogar destinado al agua dobla el estándar globalmente aceptado. A pesar de que el suministro total ha aumentado, hay una mayor dependencia (obligada) de Mekorot. Prueba de las dificultados impuestas sobre los palestinos a la hora de desarrollar su propia industria del agua es el hecho de que el JWC ha rechazado la mayoría de proyectos propuestos desde Palestina, mientras todos menos uno de los proyectos propuestos por israelíes has sido aprobados. El aspecto más negativo es que, a pesar de que Oslo II reforzara una desigualdad ya latente, la compañía israelí todavía trata de rebajar aún más los mínimos establecidos en los acuerdos. El hecho de que las condiciones respecto al agua establecidas en Oslo II no hayan sido revisadas en 20 años retrata la poca importancia que los actores internacionales han dado a la situación. Incluso el Banco Mundial, que publicó el ya mencionado informe, es el principal promotor del proyecto para el Canal del Mar Rojo – Mar Muerto, un acuerdo entre Israel, Jordania y la Autoridad Palestina (aunque el presidente de la Autoridad del Agua Palestina alega que el acuerda se llevó a cabo principalmente entre los dos primeros ). La gran mayoría de las ONGs palestinas demandaron el cese de todas las formas de cooperación y un rechazo público al proyecto, pues continúa legitimando la desposesión de los derechos del agua llevada a cabo en Palestina. El Panel de Inspección del Banco Mundial que investigó el impacto del proyecto en las poblaciones palestinas consideró legítimos los argumentos de la resistencia, pero decidió no actuar. Finalmente, varios países han recibido consultoría y conocimientos de Mekorot: Argentina, Australia, Azerbaiyán, Brasil, Bosnia, Canadá, Chipre, Grecia, India, Malta, México, Serbia, Corea del Sur, Reino Unido y los Estados Unidos. Mekorot también se ha beneficiado del Acuerdo de Asociación UE-Israel, que provee de condiciones de negocio preferentes a Israel con 27 miembros de la UE. Merece especial mención el contrato de 120 millones de euros firmado entre el Banco Europeo de Inversiones y una subsidiaria de Mekorot para la construcción de una planta desalinizadora. Intentos de acceso a la justicia Además de la ya desarrollada resistencia a la ocupación del territorio palestino, también ha habido una estrategia organizada para impedir las violaciones de los derechos del agua de Mekorot. Puesto que no existe prácticamente ninguna posibilidad de remedio a corto o medio plazo desde el gobierno de Israel, las comunidades afectadas han tenido que buscar el apoyo de la comunidad internacional para conseguir el acceso a la justicia. La campaña Stop Mekorot ha diseñado una cuidadosa estrategia de resistencia, estructurada en cuatro niveles: movilización de la comunidad; incidencia política pública (public advocacy); campañas de boicot, desinversión y sanciones; y lobbying e incidencia legal (legal advocacy). Algunas de estas acciones han recibido una notable respuesta internacional. Por ejemplo, el Secretario General de la ONU incluyó en su informe de la 25a sesión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos una condena de las políticas de Mekorot. El informe de la misión independiente de la ONU para las implicaciones de los asentamientos israelíes sobre los derechos del pueblo palestino también retrató las actividades de la compañía. Una publicación del Parlamento francés llegó a referirse a estas políticas como ""apartheid del agua"". La Primera Semana Internacional Contra Mekorot fue organizada entre los días 22 y 30 de Marzo de 2014, con movilizaciones por todo el mundo. Las presiones hacia compañías y países para que no se involucrasen en negocios con Mekorot dieron como resultado tres victorias destacables. A finales de 2013, tras tres años de campaña, activistas argentinos consiguieron detener un contrato de 170 millones que habría dado la posibilidad a Mekorot de construir una planta de tratamiento de agua en La Plata (Buenos Aires); de nuevo, a finales de 2013, la compañía pública holandesa Vitens canceló un Memorándum de Entendimiento con Mekorot debido a que la cooperación con la compañía ""no puede ser separada de lo que la ONU escribe acerca de las políticas de Mekorot [...] en los territorios palestinos y los asentamientos""; y en Marzo de 2014, la también compañía pública EPAL en Lisboa (Portugal) anunció que, tras una campaña de alto nivel, terminaba su acuerdo de cooperación con Mekorot antes de finalizar su periodo de vigencia. Lo que la justicia podría hacer: una opinión del TPP En la sesión en Ginebra de junio, 2014, el Tribunal Permanente de los Pueblos (TPP) escuchó el testimonio de Abeer Al Butmeh, Stop the Wall / Pengon. Considerando lo expuesto ante los jueces del tribunal, éste reconoció las acciones de la corporación transnacional como otro ejemplo de violaciones de derechos humanos y de los pueblos. De acuerdo a la sentencia de Madrid, en mayo de 2010, y unos meses antes de la sesión que tuvo lugar en México en Diciembre 2014, el TPP resaltó de nuevo cómo las corporaciones transnacionales, incluida Mekorot, violan sistemáticamente estos derechos para su propio beneficio. El tribunal reconoció en esta extendida práctica la evidente limitación del derecho internacional. La imposibilidad del acceso a la justicia y a obtener remediación está convirtiéndose en una carga cada vez mayor para las comunidades afectadas, así como las leyes que deberían protegerlas. Así mismo, el TPP reconoció la necesidad de mejorar la legislación internacional, incluyendo un tratado vinculante para las corporaciones transnacionales y un Tratado de los Pueblos, para que así estas empresas sean consecuentes con sus acciones.",mekorot-and-the-opt-israel-palestine,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The City of Mount Vernon, NY has continuously ignored various court orders, fines, and administrative compliance orders placed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and conservationists, to repair leaking sewer systems that are contaminating the Hutchinson River. The City and its administration have refused to act on these ordinances for 15 years [10]. This negligence puts the citizens and ecosystem of not only Mount Vernon but all surrounding and downstream communities at risk.  The Hutchinson River is a freshwater stream that begins in Scarsdale, New York and travels about 10 miles south through Westchester County and the Bronx, eventually emptying into Eastchester Bay on the Long Island Sound. It also serves as one of the tributaries for the East River that separates parts of New York City and Long Island. The river contains three damned sections that serve as reservoirs, none of which are still used as water sources for Westchester County. These three reservoirs now serve as public lands often used for various outdoor recreational activities [7]. The northern portion of the river is relatively clean with many parts being characterized more as a stream or creak than a river. Once it reaches the City of Mount Vernon, however, the Hutchinson River becomes nearly uninhabitable by wildlife and a health hazard to anyone exposed to its water. Mount Vernon is a predominately minority and low income community with a poverty rate of 14.7% and 63.1% identifying as either Black or African American—a stark contrast to the wealth and whiteness that the surrounding towns and Westchester County hold as a whole[16]. This makes the likelihood of the city being the victim of environmental injustice more than the surrounding cities and towns like Bronxville or Scarsdale; both of which are predominantly white and wealthy (er).  Mount Vernon has a longstanding history of refusing to make much needed repairs to their sewage systems. In 2003, the City of Mount Vernon began to develop Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4's) to ""detect and eliminate illicit discharges"" [1]. These illicit discharges were raw and untreated domestic sewage that were being improperly disposed of in the Hutchinson River as well as sewage pipe leakage that further contributed to this pollution. This plan, while entirely necessary for the health and safety of community members and surrounding environment, failed to make any changes as Mount Vernon failed to meet their 2008 deadline [2]. Waste continued to pollute the river as the pipes fell further into disarray with multiple sewage pipe collapses in 2012. In January 2012, a pipe burst on Lorraine Avenue, and in June 2012 another pipe burst on Stevens Avenue [10]. Not only did both of these eruptions cause further pollution to the Hutchinson River and Bronx Rivers, but they also caused communities to come into direct contact with hazardous, fecal waste. Despite this being a direct result of their inaction, the City of Mount Vernon still did nothing to address their sewage system.  In February of 2014, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued the City of Mount Vernon an administrative compliance order ""for failure to comply with the conditions and limitation of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (""SPDES"") General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (""MS4's"") and for the unpermitted discharge of sanitary sewage into waters of the United States."" This required the City to submit regular reports to the Environmental Protection Agency detailing their research, progress and action per the EPA's request. The City of Mount Vernon however failed to adhere to these requests and make the necessary changes. This caused the EPA to issue a second administrative compliance order for violating the original order as well as continued violation of the Clean Water Act. This mandate imposed potential fines for up to $37,500 per day the City refused to act. In 2017, it was estimated that the City had accumulated around $90 million in fines from the Environmental Protection Agency [10].There have been multiple lawsuits and court orders filed attempting to convince the municipalities to protect their citizens and repair their sewers. The most recent (as of April 2021) being when United States District Judge Cathy Seibel issued a September 21st Order that requires Mount Vernon to have their Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System comply with the Clean Water Act [3]. This is almost identical to the multitude of prior court orders calling for Mount Vernon City officials to do better. This inaction has threatened Mount Vernon residents and communities along the Hutchinson River, with the contaminants carried downstream and emptied into the Long Island Sound, endangering thousands more people. The continued mishandling of domestic waste is the sole fault of the Mount Vernon municipalities. These include not only the current acting mayor, Mayor Andrè Wallace, (who took over after Mayor Richard Thomas was removed by the City Council) but also his predecessors who chose to overlook the dangers of inaction. The blame also falls to Mount Vernon's City Council, Comptroller, and specifically the City of Mount Vernon Department of Public Works Bureau of Sewers. On the City's website it states that the Bureau of Sewers is responsible for the maintenance and care of 195 miles of sewer lines. With the continuation of Clean Water Act violations due to sewage contamination, we see the incompetence of not only the Bureau of Sewers but the municipality as a whole.  In doing so they have risked the health and wellbeing of the residents of not only Mount Vernon but the Pelhams, the Bronx, along with inhabitants along Eastchester Bay, Long Island Sound, and the East River. The mouth of this river opens in close proximity to homes and poses a threat to the health and safety of visitors to Orchard Beach, the Bronx's largest public beach, as well as inhabitants of New York City and Long Island. Residents of Mount Vernon and the Pelhams specifically express their disdain for the foul odor that emanates from the Hutchinson River as well as unsightly litter that accumulates on the river's edge.While the City of Mount Vernon hasn't participated or released any data of their own, the effects of raw sewage contamination are far reaching. The independent nonprofit organization Save the Sound, has an annual Bacteria and Water Quality Monitoring Program that tests western Long Island Sound waterways. In 2019, they found that the concentration of fecal bacteria pollution in the Hutchinson River was on average 40 times higher than New York State's limit for safe swimming water. It is estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency that (broadly) between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people each year contract recreational waterborne illnesses after coming in contact with water polluted by sewage overflow. Exposure to improperly disposed of sewage and fecal matter can lead to contracting a waterborne illness, parasites, or viruses, all with varying severity. Despite the most commonly reported recreational waterborne illness being diarrhea, which can be fatal for at risk populations, there are many that are commonly contracted and have the ability to be extremely dangerous and sometimes fatal. The bacteria Vibrio cholerae, known for causing cholera, is common in areas with high volumes of fecal matter, and if severe, can cause severe dehydration and even death within hours of infection. Other parasites and viruses like Giardia lamblia which initially can cause diarrhea, can develop into long term symptoms of severe hypothyroidism and even lactose intolerance. The Hepatitis viruses are commonly contracted in polluted waterways and can cause liver infection and even liver failure [8]. There are also grave implications of indirect exposure to sewage contamination. The polluted water in the Hutchinson River has the potential to seep into the river bed and infiltrate sources of groundwater. This spreads the pollution and its subsequent diseases much further and is often too discreet to be accurately traced and dealt with. The Hutchinson River not only poses a health hazard to the people who may choose to utilize it, but to its surrounding ecosystem. Within the river, plant and animal life is scarce with the current conditions being unsustainable/inhospitable for aquatic life. The river also poses a threat to the local non-aquatic wildlife who may choose to cross the river or even possibly ingest the contaminated water. Westchester County already boasts a long list of threatened and endangered species which includes the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), the river otter (Lutra canadensis) and the eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa) [14].  The City of Mount Vernon's 15 year refusal to repair their sewage system has led to damage throughout its own community and those surrounding it. This negligence has led to countless legal actions as well as copious amounts of state and federal fines. Despite all this the City continues to ignore the health and wellbeing of its citizens with little to no progress being made. The current status of the project is the same as when it was first addressed in 2003. No action has been taken to even start the work that needs to be done to clean up the Hutchinson River and preserve the health of the people it affects. This can cause severe and irreversible damage to the immediate and surrounding ecosystem and the communities that inhabit it.",contamination-of-hutchinson-river-mt-vernon-ny-usa,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The city of Valencia is located in an area of extraordinarily fertile land (called l'Horta de Valencia). Especially since the 1960s, all types of urban development (houses, roads, industries, shopping centers, universities, and museums) have taken place at the expense of l'Horta de Valencia. La Punta is one of the districts of Valencia, located south of the city. In the 1990s, this was the largest remaining land of Horta near the city of Valencia. This district was very peculiar; there were no shops, no streets, and the old agricultural roads remained the main connections between the houses. There were 22 so-called barracas, the traditional Valencian agricultural houses, and it was an area adjacent to the Albufera Natural Park. Most of the population in this district was over 60 years old, and their lives were intimately linked to small-scale agricultural activities. In 1993, a new urban plan for the city of Valencia called ZAL (Logistics Activity Zone) was promoted by the Ministry of Public Works, the regional government, the Valencia City Council, and the Port of Valencia. This plan changed the status of 75 hectares of fertile Valencian land from the green belt to construction land. The project also involved the destruction of 188 traditional agricultural houses and the eviction of over 200 families.  Since then and for several years, the residents decided to organize into groups to fight for the defense of l'Horta. Many sectors of Valencian society joined the fight: academics, farmers, students, even squatters. There was active resistance to try to prevent evictions, while there were also massive demonstrations (over 10,000 people), with petitions, demands against this urban development plan, etc. In 2009, the High Court of Justice certified that the Plan was canceled because it was illegal. In 2013, the Supreme Court of Justice ratified the previous judgment of the High Court of Justice in which the Plan was declared null.  However, justice was too late in this case. 75 hectares of fertile land were destroyed, all traditional farms in the area were demolished, and about a hundred families were displaced. The expansion of the port never happened either.  Between 2017/2018, the conflict was reactivated. Despite the previously mentioned judgments, for the third time, the Valencian Generalitat Administration has initiated a procedure to approve the Special Plan for the development of the ZAL (Logistics Activity Zone) of the Port of Valencia. The procedure is currently being assumed by the General Directorate of Public Works, Transport, and Mobility (of the Valencian Generalitat) and involves the Port Authority and the Ajuntament de València.  This has led to the reactivation of the Per L ́Horta Platform, which on this occasion is called ""Plataforma Horta és futur NO a la ZAL"" (Horta is the future NO to the ZAL). In its manifesto, it demands the opening of a citizen participation process to decide what future should be given to the La Punta area. It considers that the money invested cannot be used as an excuse and demands the repair of the injustice (deportation of neighbors, etc.) carried out in previous attempts and insists that ""another way of doing territorial politics is possible.""  The interpretation keys of the conflict are between the public sector, which understands that it is facing urban land and that they have carried out urbanization works, and, on the other hand, the citizen platform that considers that the acts of management and urbanization have not been carried out legally (for having been carried out in a plan considered null) and the urbanization works comply with the uses foreseen in the current urban planning (in which the lands are classified as orchard). Therefore, according to this second interpretation, the lands of La Punta are in the current PGOU as Non-Urbanizable Land of Special Agricultural Protection AG-1. And above all, what determines the decision on what to do with the lands is an object of public participation in the different possibilities that are open.  There is a citizen outcry demanding a participation process as well as several proposals on the table, from renowned urban professionals, biologists, ecologists, representatives of civil society organizations, etc., to find a way out of the conflict.  In 2019, there was a new escalation of the conflict. With a new reactivation of the project: expansion of the ZAL. On this occasion, we want to highlight two aspects. Once again, in this reactivation, there has been no citizen participation process, and civil society has concentrated its efforts on the creation of a commission called ""Comissió Ciutat -Port"" (City-Port Commission), which brings together very different organizations; it is an alliance of alliances: Per L'Horta, Ecological-Action Agró, Ecologistas en Acción, Associació de Veïns i Veïnes Natzaret, and Plataforma El Litoral Per al Poble. We are talking about a conflict that, in essence, represents two development models: an expansive one with unspecified environmental problems and another that rescues proposals deeply rooted among the population, from the beginning of the conflict, which includes elements of restorative justice. It should be noted that the conflict is at a high level of escalation, and most of the environmental information we have, as those who analyze environmental conflicts, comes from the side of civil organizations. The environmental information from the representatives of the Port Authority, the Ministry of Public Works, and even the Valencia City Council does not meet the minimum requirements of transparency and good governance.  We provide links that update the information on the conflict. (Last updated June 6, 2020).",port-expansion-in-la-punta-valencia-spain,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"A coalition, ""SHOUT - Spring Hunting Out"" has been formed in Malta, comprising ENGOs (led by Birdlife Malta), the Green Party (Alternattive Demokratika) and public personalities, and is also supported by Malta's three English speaking newspapers. The aim of the coalition is to stop hunting of birds in Spring in line with the EU Birds' Directive. Hunting became an electorally significant issue in the 1996 general elections, when Labour promised to be closer to the aspirations of the hunting lobby. Subsequently, both the Labour (1996-98; 2013-) and Nationalist (1998-2013) Governments attempted to give concessions to the hunters' lobby. It was also a controversial topic in subsequent elections and during Malta's EU accession process - characterized by a referendum and general election in 2003, (Malta joined in 2004) Labour opposed Malta's EU entry, but the Nationalist Government claimed to obtain concessions for hunters. Following Labour's 2013 electoral victory, the campaign for an abroagative referendum commenced by ENGOs and the Green Party. The issue has been characterized by antagonisms at national and European levels, and has been subject to contrasting interpretations regarding the implementation of the Birds' Directive and regarding a decision by the European Courts of Justice on the matter. Respective Nationalist and Labour Governments and the hunting lobby have supported hunting in Spring. On the other hand, environmentalists interpreted Malta's application of an EU derogation as infringing the Birds' Directive. Subsequently, the environmentalist coalition successfully gathered signatures for a a legally-binding abrogative national referendum on the matter, which is due to take place on 11 April 2015.",referendum-to-end-bird-hunting-in-spring,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Biseni is an Ijaw oil producing community in Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Shell Petroleum and Development Company was the first company to prospect for oil within the community in the early seventies. It was closely followed by Nigeria Agip Oil Company in the 80s. Today, the community is host to some 78 oil wells and several clusters. Shell operation in the community continues to threaten the livelihoods of the local people, as multiple spills in Biseni becomes a regular scenario. The crude had leaked from a rupture on the Well 4 delivery trunk line, in the Shell Biseni oilfields, connected to the Adebawa Flow Station in Jokrama (4) Community of Rivers state. Shell officials were alerted to the rupture in November, 2006 and it was attributed to equipment failure. In December 2006, there were two separate fire outbreak in the community caused by the spilled crude oil for several days.

"RCA came to Taiwan in 1969 to produce electronic parts for televisions, employing more than 30,000 people at its peak production. Most of them on the production line were women from poor families. The US company was found to have dumped toxic waste at its Taoyuan factory in northern Taiwan polluting the soil and underground water, leading to alarmingly high reports of cancer among its workers. Workers were required to use organic solvents including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene to clean printed circuit boards. Both are classified as Group 2A carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which means that they are probably carcinogenic to humans. These agents enter the body through inhalation, skin contact, and ingestion. Without any warning or training from RCA, the workers breathed the volatile solvents in the air of the factory which had almost no ventilation and touched the chemicals with their hands that were only covered with cotton gloves in the manufacturing process. Workers living in the factory dormitories also used untreated water pumped from the same ground where RCA had dumped waste solvents, for drinking, washing up, and laundry. In 1998, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration confirmed that the area where the plant located was designated a permanently polluted zone, the first case of its kind in this country.Litigation continued until the late 2010s. As reported in October 2017, ""a ruling by the Taiwan High Court in favor of RCA workers whose health was affected by industrial pollution is a victory, not only for RCA workers but for Taiwanese labor overall. A landmark case in Taiwanese labor, the case is also a case with few precedents in Taiwanese jurisprudence, as a class action lawsuit with hundreds of plaintiffs. Subsequently, it remains to be seen what will come next for efforts to secure justice for RCA workers. RCA employed thousands of workers in Taiwan between 1970 and 1992, through a Taiwanese subsidiary of the American company, the Radio Corporation of America. However, industrial pollution from the RCA plant in Taoyuan led to 78 deaths caused by the pollution, and 237 of the 529 workers involved in the case developed cancer or related illnesses. In part, the reason as to why the case would become so well known is because it involves an American company whose actions permanently damaged the health of Taiwanese workers. Based on environmental assessments previously conducted by RCA, many believe that RCA was aware of the pollution but did nothing about it.""[1][1] Brian Hioe, 29 Oct. 2017. https://newbloommag.net/2017/10/29/rca-ruling-second-hearing/",radio-corporation-of-america,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been used by the Panamanian government as a justification to promote an increase in the number of open-pit metal mines in the country as part of an economic reactivation ""strategy"" [1]. Ignoring the extensive biodiversity of its tropical forests and water resources [2], the government insists on promoting mining as an economic recovery activity despite serious risks, given the large number of approved contracts (14) and concession applications (130) are located in areas near or overlapping protected areas, watershed source areas, and biological corridors. Considering the topography of the country and its narrow territory, which includes more than 500 rivers, these licenses will cause disproportionate environmental and social harm [3].On May 13, 2021, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MICI), the authority in charge of granting licenses and concessions for resource extraction, reincorporated 25,599.72 hectares [4] into the land registry for mining. Most of this land is located within the Donoso protected area of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor [5]. This was done without consultation [6] through the mechanisms for civic participation established by the Escazú Agreement, ratified by Panama in 2020[7].  Panamá Vale Más Sin Minería: Panama is worth more without mining,The actions taken by the government of Panama to promote open-pit metal mining have triggered a series of protests and other actions at the national level [8]. At the end of 2020, the government of Panama announced the development of new mining policies for the country and made clear its intentions to put a new spin on mining in the country — indicating that sustainable mining is possible and that mining will contribute to the country's economic recovery after months of restrictions and labour shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first part of 2021 was decisive for communities affected by Empresa Minera Panamá's operations who, in response to the government's announcements to expand the mining exploitation zones in the province of Coclé, began to mobilize and seek support from national organizations. Protests took place throughout the country, in an effort to point out the dangers of mining and denounce the exclusion of the population in the decision making around mining.  Students from the University of Panama (located in Coclé, a province directly affected by Minera Panamá) have taken part in protests. Environmental and civic organizations, NGOs, social movements, and educators associations from all over the country have joined in the protests and have advanced a national campaign called Panamá Vale más sin minería (Panama is worth more without mining, in English).  The national movement is fighting to stop the government's intentions to turn Panama into a mining country. In the midst of the Covid 19 crisis, the government argues that it is necessary to save the national economy by handing over the territory to Canadian mines. Attempts to promote metal mining as a ""sustainable""Minera Panamá has widely disseminated its messages across all forms of media (radio, print, television, social media networks), conveying a message that ""for our long-term success, it is fundamental that we earn and maintain community support for mining. We seek to bring tangible benefits to the employees and communities around the mining projects. Our global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program seeks to balance best practice with the needs of each site and the host communities in each country where we operate. In our CSR program and strategy, our initiatives and activities are consistent with international best practice and are carried out systematically at all sites. These are just some of the many examples of our CSR programs around the world"" [9][10].  Social unrest over the promotion of metal mining as a ""sustainable"" economic activity has grown since the media reported on a recent spill of mine wastewater into a local river [11]. If new mining concessions are granted within the Donoso protected area, not only will the number of spills in the area likely increase, but the species in the region will be cut off from the natural migration routes provided by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.  Environmental issuesThe development or operation of the copper mine has generated environmental, social, labour, and cultural impacts that have not received due attention. The Ministry of the Environment has recognized that mining has already led to 209 environmental violations of the Environmental Impact Assessment, and that many of these are repeat violations by the company.  For example, a 2019 news article stated that ""Wastewater discharges from the mine and port 'cause negative impacts on natural ecosystems and human populations [...] through the contribution of hazardous pollutants, heavy metals, disease-causing pathogens.'""  For the citizens of Panama, this is not surprising. It is widely recognized that the Ministry of the Environment carries no institutional weight. Many of the mechanisms for environmental monitoring and oversight lack the qualified personnel or the equipment to be effective. On the other hand, instances of serious environmental violations are reduced to merely an administrative record of non-compliance and are issued a negligible sanction. [12]  Labour, health and corruption issuesWith regards to labour issues, workers at the Panama copper mine are in an ongoing labour dispute with Minera Panama. The Ministry of Labour (MITRADEL) has not acted within its mandate to protect labour rights, but rather has acted as a mediator between Minera Panama and various unions —including the Sindicato Industrial de Trabajadores Mineros de Panamá (STM), Sindicato Independiente de Trabajadores de la Construcción (SINDICOS) and Sindicato Único Nacional de Trabajadores de la Construcción y Similares (SUNTRACS) — to promote negotiation and conflict resolution, particularly around the following issues:  Violation of freedom of trade unionismHiring of foreign workers without labour permitsComplaints of massive hiring of foreign workers and not including workers from affected communities [13]. Regarding the issue of health, the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mine Development Workers (STM) have denounced many health issues during the pandemic. They have urged the Ministry of Health (MINSA) to immediately relocate more than 2,000 workers who remain on site at Minera Panama's mine due to ""risks posed by unsanitary conditions and a lack of infrastructure to implement preventative measures to avoid the massive spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)."" In April 2020, a third Minera Panamá employee was reported dead. Members of the workers' union denounced the company for its lack of responsibility. Minera Panamá and the subcontractor Stracon reported the death of their employee who worked on the Panama copper project, which led to inspections carried out by the Ministry of Health.  With regards to the issue of corruption, this mining company has been in the spotlight for several years for allegations of having manipulated information that implicated former Panamanian presidents.  The mining company Petaquilla Gold has initiated an investment arbitration against Panama at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), demanding close to US$2.8 billion for a mining concession that was cancelled in 2015. According to information published by Agencia EFE, on October 5, 2021, the law firm K&L Gates LLP filed the claim in ICSID (see ""Owners of extinct gold mine in Panama claim €2.39 billion (06.10.2021).In December 2017, Panama's Supreme Court declared a 1997 contract between Petaquilla and the State of Panama unconstitutional [14]. Panama had initially made available some 13,600 hectares for mining exploitation, later dividing that amount in half in 2014 and leaving Petaquilla Gold with approximately 645 hectares. The mine is currently owned by Canadian company First Quantum Minerals through its Panamanian subsidiary, Minera Panamá S.A [15]. The Supreme Court declared the contract unconstitutional for the following reasons: not complying with the basic principles of public procurement, not representing the interests of the State and for ignoring social welfare and public interest. However the mine continued to operate under the pretense that the ruling was not yet final [16].The contract between the State of Panama and Pataquilla Gold was a twenty-year concession to exploit the mineral resources of Cerro Petaquilla, later known as Molejón, and the lawsuit responded to a constitutional challenge filed by the Environmental Advocacy Center in 2009 for endangering Panama's biodiversity.The 2017 ruling meant the end of the contract with Petaquilla, and even then, there was a warning of the possible investor arbitration claim in international courts. In May of 2021, the Panamanian Ministry of Commerce and Industries invalidated the Molejón mining concession granted to Petaquilla Gold, converting the nearly 645 hectares into a reserve.  The Ministry accused the company of failing to remedy non-compliances related to royalty payments and environmental protection measures (see ""Estado recupera tierra concesionada a Petaquilla."" Ohigginis Arcia Jaramillo, La Prensa, 15.05.2021). After nine years, the February 25, 1997 contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Despite the Court's ruling, the government of Panama announced on July 14, 2020 that it would initiate a ""renegotiation"" process for Minera Panama's contract so that the mine could continue operating [17]. Only after the government's announcement that the contract would be renegotiated, the Supreme Court finally rejected the appeals filed by Minera Panama against the ruling [18].""Mining is not the way to combat climate change""Despite this series of actions by the government to try to turn Panama into a mining country, the government was recently in Glasgow for COP26 ensuring the target of 1.5C was written into the Paris agreement [19]. However, as the Center for Environmental Advocacy- CIAM Panamá points out, ""The government's strategy to promote mining in a biodiverse country such as Panamá shows that the discourses of climate change and conservation are just empty arguments. This is a Climate Emergency. Speeches do not save ecosystems, actions do #PanamaValemássinMinería"" [20].For the Movimiento Panamá sin Mineras, ""mining is not the way to combat climate change"". On the contrary, the fight against climate change is realized by protecting ecosystems such as the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and preventing mining from reaching these territories and ecosystems.",petaquilla-panama,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"Andap Valley Complex holds the world's largest coal block reserve. On the 1st September 2015, members of the paramilitary group Magahat-Bagani allegedly killed three Indigenous Lumad leaders in Sitio Han-ayan, Diatagon: Emerito Samarca, executive director of Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development (Alcadev); Dionel Campos, chair of Mapasu; and Mapasu member Datu Juvello Sinzo [1].The valley is home to 3,000 Lumad who fled Lianga town for the provincial capital after the September killings. Caraga Watch affirmed that ""The purpose of the militarization of Andap Valley Complex is clear: to remove any opposition against the entry of coal mining companies into the ancestral lands of the Lumad,""[2]. Mining companies have been raring to operate since 2015 but were constantly prevented because of the refusal of the Lumad communities to sign the Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) agreement. The planned coal mining operations would affect the towns of San Miguel, San Agustin, Marihatag, Cagwait, Tago and Lianga, all in Surigao del Sur[3].Since 2008, the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) has formed the Investment Defense Force (IDF) to ""give a protective shield to power assets, other infrastructures and mineral development projects""[3]. The IDF continues to sow terror to the Lumad communities up to the present administration[3]. On July 16, 2018, 1,600 residents from the towns of Lianga and San Agustin were evicted because of the presence of soldiers. The army claimed that the eviction was being instigated by sympathizers of the NPA (New Peoples Army) who do not want the troops in the area. Meanwhile, Abacus Coal Exploration and Mining Corporation brought coal-mining machinery into the Andap Valley [3]. The massive forced eviction of Lumads has happened since 2005, specially those part of the group Malahutayong Pakigbisog Alang sa Sumusunod (MAPASU). This was exacerbated after Dutertes' Executive Order 70 [7], which created Task Forces to End the Local Communist Armed Conflict centered on indigenous peoples' resistance to development projects [6].Residents in Nueva Vizcaya have mounted barricades against the entry and continuing operation of mining corporation Oceana Gold Philippine Inc. (OGPI). Despite the expiration of the company's Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement No. 1, the company and its security personnel have shown a letter by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea allowing the entry of fuel trucks inside the mining area. On April 6, 2020, more than 100 personnel of the Philippine National Police dispersed violently the barricades of the community, escorting a diesel tanker inside the OGPI mining area [9]. Meanwhile, on July 15, 2020, at least 37 Lumad families in Sitios Panukmoan and Decoy in Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del Sur were bombed by  Armed Forces of the Philippines at 2 a.m. and at least 37 Lumad families had to evacuate to a neighboring community.  Around 60 soldiers also arrived that day in Sitio KM 16 of the said barangay. Bombings were also heard in the nearby town of Tago on July 8, while gunshots from military helicopters were also reported on July 9th [9].The last attack was on June 15, 2021, when two Lumad farmers and a 12-year old student were killed by soldiers in Lianga, Surigao del Sur [8]. Angel was a Grade 6 student of the Lumad school Tribal Filipino Program of Surigao del Sur (TRIFPSS) while Rodriguez and Lenie were members of Mapasu. Karapatan-Caraga reported that soldiers brought their remains to the military brigade headquarters in St. Christine, Lianga and presented them as members of the New People's Army [8]. The genitalia of the two women victims Angel and Lenie were also reportedly shattered and probably raped. Especially knowing that President Duterte ordered the military to ""shoot female rebels in the vagina"", as reported by SOS Network [8].Two of the strongest organizations opposing this encroachment are Lumad schools and MAPASU, of which Lenie and Willy were both members. The Lumad schools provide the needed education and healthcare the government fails to provide to the Lumad people, and they also serve as a flow of communication between the Lumad and their allies. The schools helped document the state's human rights violations, spread awareness internationally, and educate students on how to preserve their ancestral lands[10].Due to militarization, government intervention, and COVID, all 200+ Lumad schools have been closed, affecting approximately 10,000 students [10].",militarization-of-lumad-lands-for-coal-mining,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Tablas Island is a mountainous area in Romblon which covers critical watershed and forest reserves that provide vital water supply to agriculture, small industries and tap water for human consumption. It also has watershed areas that protect against increasingly common flash floods. Its rich gold, copper, marble, and other deposits attracted Ivanhoe Philippines Inc., a subsidiary of Canadian company Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., to propose a mining project covering 15,000 hectares on the island [5]. However, such mining activities would threaten the indigenous Ati community living there, who were worried about mining activities having already made their land vulnerable to mine dailing flooding, landslides, and storm surges [5, 11, 12]. Approximately 70,000 trees would also have to be cleared to establish the mine [6]. These trees are home to more than 123 species and is a conservation priority zone for amphibians and reptiles [13]. Mine wastes would furthermore devastate the marine life which locals depend on for their fishing livelihoods during a time when the locals had already been suffering from limited food and water supplies from previous agribusiness exploitation [15]. The Ati had not consented to mining exploration in their territory and were unanimously against the project. Ivanhoe, however, argued that their project was not overlapping with their territory even though their proposal covered most of their land [11, 13]. Ivanhoe had also been bribing community leaders with food and drinks [13]. Exploration began in late December of 2009, and some residents reported mining activity near their family farms before the exploration permit was even approved on March 1, 2010 [15]. In response, teacher and mother of two Sheryll ""Sweet"" Mindo-Fetalvero stepped up to become one of the faces of the local anti-mining struggle. She founded the Alliance of Students Against Mining (ASAM) and the Romblon Ecumenical Forum Against Mining (REFAM) to raise public awareness by distributing flyers, giving lectures, and screening documentaries about the dangers of mining [7]. Her advocacy and organization of anti-mining rallies and meetings immediately made her a target for harassment, smear campaigns, and threats. She also began having conflicts with her husband, who was initially was supportive and a member of the cause, later accused her of spending more time on the anti-mining campaign than with their children and jeaopardizing the safety of the family. Continuing her advocacy regardless, she continued to further her activism, having meetings with top leaders of the province and other authorities. Her battles in a male-dominated space and general society noticeably transformed her to become very tough and decisive [1]. She asserted her authority by saying, ""Motherhood goes beyond the confines of home and being a teacher doesn't stop in the pillars of schooling ... I have a beautiful dream: a healthier, better, and mining-free environment for my children and the students of Romblon."" Often bringing her toddlers to anti-mining protests and meetings, she drew on narratives of maternal love to legitimize her activism [7].On February 14, 2011, more than 12,000 people joined together for a Valentine's Day march across various towns putting up signs and streamers and collecting thousands of supporters along the way toward the largest protest of the movement against Ivanhoe [6, 12, 14]. Finally, on September 30, 2011, Ivanhoe canceled their project, citing ""strong opposition from local politicians"" as the reason behind their decision to abandon Romblon [2, 3]. This is currently the shortest advocacy campaign against mining in Philippino history, especially impressive for a grassroots movement against a large transnational company [4]. Mindo-Fetalvero also reconciled with her husband, who now advocates for female leadership after now recognizing and understanding the power of women to make substantial change [7]. Yet the movement did not stop there, as she and her fellow activists quickly began working on House Bill 4814: ""An Act Declaring the Province of Romblon a Mining Free Zone and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof,"" or a complete moratorium on all land and underwater mining in Romblon to protect it against other mining companies now interested in the land [4, 9]. All violators would face a hefty fine and jail time for domestic violators or deporation for foreigners [12]. The moratorium was successfully enacted on January 13, 2012 with a unanimous endorsement from the senate [10, 13]. To celebrate this huge success, an anti-mining monument was unveiled on February 15, 2012 by the local Catholic church [8].",metallic-mining-moratorium-in-romblon-philippines,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"In 1991, the Department of Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) made changes to the state burning regulations, concentrating the negative impacts of burning sugar cane to those living in western Palm Beach County [1]. The new regulations did not allow sugarcane to be burned if the winds blew towards the eastern, more coastal cities but permitted burns if the wind blew towards the western black and brown communities [2]. These changes spare the more affluent citizens in the county while disproportionately impacting the poorer, minority communities. As a whole, Palm Beach County consists of approximately 20% black residents, 23% Hispanic, and 57% white residents [1]. Pahokee, South Bay, and Belle Glade, the three towns that represent the western side of the county on Lake Okeechobee, consist of approximately 60% black residents, 27% Hispanic residents, and 13% white residents [1]. Additionally, as a whole Palm Beach County has under 10% of its total residents living in poverty, while 40% of Belle Glade residents, the largest western town, live below the poverty line [1,3].   Pre-harvest burning is not a new process; in fact, it is outdated and there are other, greener practices to harvest sugarcane. However, it still is the preferred method by the sugar industry because it reduces transportation costs and makes the harvest process quicker and easier (removes excess biomass, reduces insect and snake intrusion, causes water evaporation which increases sugar content) [4]. The sugarcane stalks are heavy because they're water-rich.  When the plant is burned the leaves fall off and just the stalks remain, which greatly reduces the plant's weight. The burning also releases harmful byproducts of smoke, soot, and ash into the air [5]. In one year, the sugarcane burning process can emit over 2,800 tons of hazardous air pollutants [6]. Some of these pollutants include particulate matter (including PM 2.5 and PM 10), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) (such as Benzene), Carbonyls (specifically Formaldehyde), Green House Gases (Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Nitrogen Oxide), and various Dioxins [1]. Despite the environmental and health consequences of these pollutants, the companies still choose to burn sugarcane [5]. Compared to the rest of the United States, Florida has the most crop burning residue emissions. They emit ""17% of the total national CO2, CO and PM2.51 emissions, 12% of all annual PM10 emissions, and 9.5% of all CH4 emissions from crop residue burning"" [4].   The soot and ash released into the air vary in size. The EPA defines inhalable coarse particles as particles ranging from 2.5-10 micrometers in diameters and fine particles usually found in haze and smoke range in diameters up to 2.5 micrometers [7]. Both of which are released during pre-harvest burning. Particulate matter is one of the deadliest forms of air pollution because of its ability to penetrate the lungs and bloodstream of the human body [7]. Some of the health effects include asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, premature delivery, birth defects, premature death, vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, radiation exposure [7]. All of these effects are health problems faced by residents from Pahokee, Belle Glade, and South Bay. For every 100,000 residents in Palm Beach County, there were 700 asthma-related hospitalizations. This is almost five times the state average [8]. For almost 8 months of every year the residents watch ""black snow,"" a term for the ash and smoke pollution, fall from the sky. It invasively coats the community members' cars, homes, and clothes [8]. The black snow lowers property value and causes property damage. It also generates a lot of costs towards the clean-up process and pollution. This creates a huge disincentive for investors and new businesses to open in western Palm Beach County [1]. The particulate matter also has negative effects on the Earth's climate and precipitation levels [7].   The preharvest burning has been going on for decades. In February 2008, the smoke found its way into the vents of South Bay's Rosenwald Elementary School. The school debated whether it was more dangerous to stay in the school or evacuate the building and risk greater exposure [3]. Six students were hospitalized and nine were treated by paramedics on-site. This occurrence shined a light on the school's relationship with the school district and the sugar industry. Six years earlier Rosenwald partnered with both groups to collect revenue on the burns and the fields around their school. Just a month before the incident, the school board was questioning whether or not to renew the lease[3]. Joseph Moore, the district's chief operating officer at the time, recommended the renewal, as the partnership would profit up to $7,000 per year over the next 5 years [3]. Ultimately disregarding the students' health and safety as the lease renewal took effect just 3 weeks after the evacuation. The director of communications for the School District of Palm Beach County, Claudia Shea, did not respond to any complaints or questions from families, students, and employees that were sent over the subsequent months regarding health questions, health concerns, and allegations that teachers were ""discouraged from speaking against the cane burning at school"" [3]. Shea eventually made a statement explaining that agriculture is the mainland use so there is not much the schools can do to not be in the immediate proximity of the sugar industry's operations. Shea also included the school board has no authority over the regulation of where the agricultural activities occurred. Which does not align with the school's involvement with the sugar industry and the lease surrounding Rosenwald [3]. Initially, the lease agreement included an educational program, Sharing Our Agricultural Roots (SOAR), that intended to immerse students in gardening and plant vegetables. However, the program description did not include the time students could work outside was decreased, to reduce exposure to the smoke and ash from the burns [3]. The air pollution impacts a typical school day as students are prohibited from outdoor play most days of the year. In more recent years the school has updated the design of buildings, so they are all connected, and the students do not have to walk outside between classes [3].Teachers have come forward on the issue. One admitted they tried to bring awareness to the burning, and they were reprimanded by their supervisor [3]. Another shared an observation on the number of students they would pass sitting in the office because their asthmatic conditions made it difficult for them to partake in P.E. class [3]. Rosenwald's latest lease with the sugar industry, which was signed in 2017, expires in 2022. It did not include the SOAR gardening program, instead, they justified that Rosenwald students benefit from the partnership by having the ""opportunity to be involved in agricultural events sponsored by U.S. Sugar"" [3].  In an October interview for Radar 2020, a weekly news show addressing current issues, Lourdes Hurtado covers a story on the impact of sugar burning on the black and Latinx residents in Palm Beach County. One of these residents being Hernando Salvidar, a Latinx sugarcane worker, in charge of the burning. He explains how the wind directions are checked before burning so the workers know where to start and they can try to control where the ashes go. They are only instructed to NOT burn if the wind is blowing towards the East, or if President Trump is in the area. When asked about his opinion of this matter, Hurtado responded by saying ""It's wrong, you know. I mean like I said he's just a human like us. Why does his life matter more than ours?"" [2]. The lives of the western Palm Beach County and the Glades community members are valued less than the surrounding, more affluent communities.The residents recognize the injustices they face, but many rely on the sugar industry for work so they cannot do much about it [2]. Their lives are put even more at risk with COVID-19. Despite the correlation between air quality and an increased chance of contracting the virus, the 2020-2021 harvesting season took place. In April of 2020, two letters were sent to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Nikki Fried, calling on her to take action. One letter was sent by businesses, non-profits, and religious institutions around the Glades area, the Florida Council of Churches, Florida Clinicians for Climate Action, and the Miami Climate Alliance [9]. In their letter, they expressed their disgust in the discriminatory nature of the burn regulations and explained that Fried has the authority and responsibility to protect Floridians from outdated agricultural practices that threaten the health and economy of many around the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). The organizations call out Fried on her statement in a 2019 press conference where she said ""Keeping Florida's residents, communities, and the environment is my number one priority"" [9]. The letter proposes that Fried should use COVID-19 as an opportunity to institute the first phase of ending pre-harvest sugar field burning by implementing a 27-30 mile buffer around the schools, homes, streets, and churches. Creating a buffer zone will prioritize the health and safety of the residents [9].   While many environmental groups are trying to get the Glade communities justice, there are also initiatives downplaying the true hazards of sugar burning. The Sustainable Agriculture Fire Education (S.A.F.E.) Communities Initiative is a group of business, agricultural, community, and faith leaders, and sugarcane farmers [10]. Their mission is to educate residents that pre-harvest burns are not linked to negative health conditions, and are necessary for South Florida's humid climate. One of these members includes the director of corporate communications for U.S. Sugar. Their website states that the ""Glades communities enjoy some of the best air quality in the state of Florida, with Palm Beach...ranking among the top of all of Florida's 67 counties"" [10]. However, the EPA's environmental justice mapping tool, which looks at demographic and environmental indicators, ranks the Glades communities within the 80th to 90th percentile in the most hazardous areas for respiratory health in the United States. Parts of South Bay and Bella Glade fall under the 95th to 100th percentile of the respiratory hazard index which is compared at the national level. This indicates that the communities in western Palm Beach County do not have good air quality [3]. The Stop the Burn Campaign has called out S.AF.E. Communities for their counter-campaign. Instead of addressing the suffering and injustice of these minority communities that are predominately impacted by the pre-harvest burns, S.A.F.E. Communities has tried to frame Stop the Burn for wanting to put the sugar industry out of business and denied burning is related to any negative health impacts [1]. Additionally, S.A.F.E. the front group for Big Sugar, opposes green harvesting, an alternative harvesting process, because they claim burning helps ""workers see where they are going. Makes it safer for truck traffic. Eliminates the messy cleanup of leaves and dry materials"". Ultimately, they prioritize saving money over the poisoning of minority, low-income communities [11]. However, the Sierra Club argues that S.A.F.E.'s excuses explaining how the sugarcane leaves can be used for additional sources of income and expand sugar-related jobs. On top of the economic benefits, the climate is less impacted, water pollution is reduced, and the soil can regenerate, which reduces the number of fertilizers needed. All around, the benefits of Green harvesting outweigh the negatives and provide a practice that is much safer than burning, for both humans and the environment [11].    There is a class-action lawsuit against Big Sugar currently underway. The lawsuit breaks down the plaintiffs into three classes: Property Owner, Medical Monitoring, and Battery. The ""Property Owner Class"" is defined as:   ""All persons and legal entities (past or present) who own or have owned real property located within the Hazard Zone during the applicable statute of limitations period, including the period following the filing date of this action."" [l2] The ""Medical Monitoring Class"" is defined as:  ""All persons (past or present) over the age of 40, or who will attain the age of 40, who have resided in the Hazard Zone for at least one pre-harvest sugarcane burn season during the applicable statute of limitations period, including the period following the filing date of this action."" [12] And the ""Battery Class: is defined as:  ""All persons (past or present) who have resided or currently reside in the Hazard Zone during the applicable statute of limitations period, including the period following the filing date of this action."" [12] Ultimately, both the class action lawsuit and other environmental campaigns want Big Sugar and the FDACs to make the shift to green harvesting. This method involves repurposing the leaves, also called ""trash"", on the soil or for alternative materials, such as tree-free paper [1, 12]. Green harvesting has also been shown to benefit soil health, decrease herbicide use, improve fertility, and over time increase net profits and crop yields [12]. As the Belle Glade Activist, Catherine Martinez, says, ""We're not asking them to do something that will destroy their business. We're asking them to move up into the 21st century"" [2].",burning-sugar-cane-in-western-palm-beach-county,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO

"Mi'kmaq communities and non-Indigenous allies have been actively opposing the completion of the Alton Gas project near Stewiacke, Nova Scotia.Alton Gas proposed to create four salt caverns in order to store natural gas underground, with the intention to build up to 15 more (they've since dropped two of the caverns).The project is designed to draw nearly 10,000 cubic metres of water daily from the Shubenacadie River estuary and push it through a 12-kilometre underground pipeline to the cavern site. There, the water will be pumped underground to flush out salt to create the caverns. The brine created by the salt dissolution will then be pumped back to the estuary for release into the river system (Campbell, 2019)Once at peak brine generation, an estimated 10,000 cubic metres of brine will be released into the river each day until all caverns have been hollowed out (Hubley, 2016). The storage caverns are needed by AltaGas subsidiary Heritage Gas, which sells natural gas in the Halifax area and to utility Nova Scotia Power, which generates 22 per cent of its electricity from natural gas. Heritage Gas wants to stockpile its product during the colder months to protect its customers from price shocks when demand spikes.Alton Gas claims of savings for natural gas customers has always been disputed (Summers, 2016). Each of the caverns are expected to be about 80 metres high by 50 metres wide. The caverns would be linked to the nearby Maritimes and Northeast natural gas pipeline, about 60 kilometres north of Halifax (Macdonald, 2018).In the fall of 2014, construction started on a brine discharge pipeline despite the fact that the development had not yet received full government approval, and ""it was met with swift protest. A camp was soon erected that was largely occupied by local Mi'kmaw protesters. For many, this was not only the first time hearing of the Alton Gas project, but also their first realization that components of their elected band leadership had known of the project for years"" (Howe, 2016).""The Mi'kmaq Rights Initiative (KMKNO), the organization which claims consulting authority for 12 of the province's 13 Mi'kmaw communities, had been aware of the project and engaged in consultations with the Nova Scotia government and Alton Gas since 2006. But in 2014, during the protests, the KMKNO publicly asserted that Alton Gas and the province had not yet fulfilled their consultative requirements in terms of compensation plans and demanded the project cease until such obligations were met""(Howe, 2016)""The Alton Gas project has received opposition from the very beginning, particularly from local First Nations Bands Sipekne'katik and Millbrook but also non-Indigenous community members. Actions included highway blockades, development site encampment and educational events, letter writing campaigns and court appealsIn April 2016, Sipekne'katik and Millbrook First Nations, the Shubenacadie River Commercial Fishermen's Association, The Council of Canadians and the Ecology Action Centre announced that they were each submitting Appeals to the provincial government ""on grounds that Alton Gas provided inadequate research, has not considered impacts on local fish populations and groundwater sources and that the province has not fulfilled its duty to meaningfully consult with First Nations communities"" (Hubley, 2016).The Sipekne'katik, Millbrook and broader Mi'kmaq mobilized to assert their treaty rights to food gathering and to defend ""Water as Life"" (Flier). In September 2016, the Mi'kmaw water protectors began watching Alton development site from a Treaty Truck House that they built along the banks of the Shubenacadie. The Treaty Truck House was built as a place from which to resist the project but it also serves to evoke the 1752 Treaty of Friendship and Peace which promised hunting, fishing, and trading rights in exchange for peace (Lewis, n.d.).A truckhouse is a trading post set up to facilitate trade between Mi'kmaq and their trading partnersand right to have a truck house is explicitly laid out in the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty (Treaty Truck House Against Alton Gas, n.d.).Mi'kmaw water protectors spent all winter in the truck house. And then on May 23, 2017, they set up a Treaty Camp along the entrance to the Alton Gas work site, effective blocking the company from working on the project. Since that time, they have built a strawbale house, a greenhouse, gardens, a chicken coup and other infrastructure at the Alton site, where Mi'kmaw water protectors live year-round.Resistance to the project is based on concern over ecological impacts including harm to fish, other wildlife and the river ecosystem. Indeed it is ""against federal regulations in the federal Fisheries Act to deposit brine into a body of water where fish frequent"" (Greenland-Smith & Poulette, 2019). There is also concern about increased greenhouse gas emissions from the natural gas production contributing to climate change (Hubley, 2016).The safety of the natural gas storage is also a major concern. ""Salt cavern gas storage has a 40% failure rate globally and a 65% failure rate in the U.S and pose a serious threat to groundwater"" (Hubley, 2016). ""These failures have lead to massive explosions that can kill or injure workers and locals, as well as to the uncontrollable release of extremely toxic chemicals into the air, soils and waters of local environments and communities, forcing locals out of their homes while threatening their health"" (Hubley, 2016)""The resistance is also based on the project violating of Treaty rights and title of Mi'kmaq.Alton Gas has also not acquired consent from the Mi'kmaq Nation and their design knowingly violates the Treaty Rights of Mi'kmaq"" (Greenland-Smith & Poulette, 2019), including their right to fish.Despite Alton's assertion that they have been consulting the Sipekne'katik First Nation since 2006, many band members say they did not hear of the project until Alton Gas started construction in 2014. ""Residents were given little-to-no notice of any public meetings for hearing their concerns about the project, before it went ahead"" (Hubley, 2016).""The government has indicated it has fulfilled its duty to meaningfully consult with First Nations about the project, in part because it acquired the approval of the Mi'kmaq Rights Initiative (KMKNO). However, both Sipekne'katik and Millbrook Nations have been polarized from the KMKNO over this issue, because they feel there has been no consultation. Despite their official appeals to halt the project until proper consultation has been followed through, the provincial government has given Alton Gas a green light (Hubley, 2016).Alton Gas says that plan has been put on hold because of ""project and regulatory planning."" (Macdonald, 2018). The company has recently asked the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board to extend its cavern construction permit to Sept. 1, 2023 (Cooke, 2018). Alton Gas has already drilled three wells at the Brentwood Road site and plans additional well drilling. The in- service date for cavern storage has been moved to 2022, a date Alton says reflects the time needed to complete the caverns (Campbell, 2019).Time Line:1752: the Treaty of Friendship and Peace was signed, promising hunting, fishing, and trading rights in exchange for peace. It also provided for a 'Truck house' (Lewis, n.d.)2006: Communications began between The Mi'kmaq Rights Initiative (KMKNO), Nova Scotia government and Alton Gas. This did not include proper consultation process.Fall 2014: Construction started on a brine discharge pipeline next to the Shubenacadie River (Hubley, 2016).Sept 2014: KMKNO publicly asserted that Alton Gas and the province had not yet fulfilled their consultative requirements and demanded the project cease until such obligations were met.January 2016:The province declared the consultations complete and gave Alton the permits to continue its work (Hubley, 2016).February 2016: The Sipekne'katik band filed an appeal with Nova Scotia's environment minister because of a perceived insufficiency in consultation with the band (Howe, 2016).At least eight others groups submit appeals to stop development on the brine release site (Hubley, 2016).March 2016: The project faces more opposition than ever (Hubley, 2016).September 2016: The Mi'kmaw water protectors begin watching Alton from a Truck House that they built along the banks of the Shubenacadie, near the Alton Gas brine dumping site.January 2017:Sipekne'katik achieve a partial court victory in overturning the Provinces rejection of their appeal (filed in February). The provincial Supreme Court judge quashed the province's rejection of the band's appeal of the plan in January, saying the band was denied procedural fairness and ruled the province wrongly refused the band's request to review and respond to reports on the project (Candian Press, 2017).May 2017: Treaty camp was built at the entrance to Alton's worksite, to prevent Alton Gas from working on the project.Sept 2017: Mi'kmaq band awarded $75,000 in court costs.Fall 2017: Water protectors at Treaty camp (and allies) began building a strawbale house at the front gate with the intention to winter at the camp.Jan 2019: There are already three wells drilled at the Brentwood Road site, near Alton and Stewiacke, and Alton Gas plans additional well drilling (Campbell 2019). The in-service date for cavern storage has been moved to 2022 (Campbell, 2019)..February 2019: Alton applied for an injunction fromSupreme Court of Nova Scotia to remove 'protestors' so that it can access to itsfacilities (Canadian Press, 2019).March 2019: Mi'kmaq matriarchs served the eviction notice to Alton Gas. This is done in conjunction with the Treaty Beneficiary Association of the Mi'kmaw People, are calling on Nova Scotians to implore their MPs to intervene in the project and sign a petition calling for its end (McShefferly, 2019). March 2019: NS supreme court approves Alton Gas' injunction to have 'protestors' removed. Outside the courthouse, a group of about 50 protesters held banners arguing the Nova Scotia courts were consistently failing to protect the rights of Indigenous people (Tutton, 2019a).  Indigenous land defenders are ordered off site, ending the 2 year occupation (Campbell, 2019).April 2019: A court order laid out a small patch of fenced land where Aboriginal and other protesters will be required to remain as they oppose a plan to store natural gas in underground caverns north of Halifax. The designated area of grassy field, about 22 metres by 38 metres, is part of a Nova Scotia Supreme Court order that details how a temporary injunction against protesters on the Alton Gas property will be applied.But opponents dismissed the official ""protest site"" as a ""play pen"" in comments on the ""Stop Alton Gas"" Facebook site. Michelle Paul posted on Twitter, ""There is no cage big enough to contain our treaty spirit"" (Tutton, 2019b).Update October 2021:On 22nd October 2021, after years of strong Mi'kmaw opposition, the company announced that the Alton Gas project on the Shubenacadie River was canceled. According to the BBC, already ""In 2018, AltaGas also ""divested its interest"" in the Nova Scotia natural gas utility, [...], as the company repositioned to focus on other areas like energy export opportunities off the west coast of North America and natural gas utilities in the U.S."" [1] In a press release, Alton company said the project has received ""mixed support, challenges and experienced delay.""

"The plans for the installation of industrial RES on the North Aegean islands were first presented in 2006. At that time there was an intense reaction by the local communities and the planed project was never realized. But in March 2012 the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change (YPEKA) set in public consultation the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the creation of wind farms in Chios, along with relevant projects in two more neighboring islands of the North Aegean (Lesvos and Limnos). On Chios island, electricity is provided by an autonomous thermoelectric power plant, as well as 15 small wind farms generating 11.40 MW in total. During the last decade, several small photovoltaic parks were built on agricultural land, as well as on roofs. The island is not interconnected to the continental Greece, as is the case for all the North Aegean islands. The investment consisted of building up industrial Renewable Energy Sources projects in the central and Northern part of Chios Island (6 wind farms with 65 windmills in Aipos Mountain and one wind farm with 10 windmills in Amani Mountain) for generating 706 MW. The technology of the windmills is outdated. The investment project named ""Aigaia Zefxi: Development of wind farms on the islands of Limnos, Chios and Lesvos, with parallel interconnection with the grid"" was planned by a partnership between the Spanish multinational Iberdrola and the Greek company Rokas Aioliki North Aegean AVEE (a subsidiary of Rokas Constructions SA). Once the YPEKA proceeded with setting the EIA in a public consultation, the reaction of the civil society was immediate: an organization named Chios' Citizens and Windmills was set up. Τhey initiated a public awareness campaign, in parallel with documentation on the investment, the impacts and the benefits for the local societies, indicating unclear points in the EIA and at the same time presenting a different development approach for the island of Chios, focusing on the energy issue as well. They also set up a network for coordination, exchange of information and knowledge, and political lobbying among the North Aegean Islands, as all the islands belong to the same Regional Authority that would have approved the EIA. The movement asked for cancellation of the announced consultation, better information on the project with the provision of all real data by the company and the Ministry and examination of alternatives [2]. Concerning the EIA's deficiencies, there is a report by Ombudsman on the completeness of the Assessment [3]. The main argument by the partnership's side for choosing the North Aegean islands for the investment was that the other Greek islands (and namely Cyclades) have an important cultural and environmental value [4]. This allegation exasperated the residents of Chios, as the area where the wind farms will be located comprises important cultural and environmental sites. Four of the planned 6 wind farms are located in areas that are proposed for inclusion in the European Landscape Convention, and they are also protected under the Habitats Directive 92/43 as they are included in the NATURA 2000 Network. Furthermore, important archaeological sites are close to the proposed wind farms' locations, as well as 9 caves are in the wind farms area [4]. The wider area is also important for bird populations, migratory included, and concrete objections were expressed by environmental NGOs and scientists on the EIA's deficiencies as well as on the impacts on bird populations during the construction and the operation phase of the wind farms [5, 6]. Furthermore, the electricity generated by the wind farms won't lead to a reduction of that generated by Chios' thermoelectric power station, but will be transferred to continental Greece, through underwater cables that will interconnect Chios with Lesvos island and Lesvos with continental Greece. The total cost of the interconnection cable (the three islands to continental Greece) is around 0.8 million euros, although any estimation is uncertain. In addition to this, it is unclear as to who will pay for it. Chios' Citizens and Windmills argues that the funds for it will be public (EU funding). In addition to this, there are considerable technical difficulties as the depths are more than 600 m. in some cases and the seabed has intense relief. Today, the EIA has been approved by the Regional Authority for the North Aegean. The approval for the installation is stuck at the Central Archaeological Council, because the local Archaeological Councils (including that of Chios) have given a negative opinion. The main points of the movement against the Industrial RES are that the project will destroy a large area of environmental, social and economic importance for the Island of Chios and it won't have any positive direct impacts to the local population or changes in the energy production locally. In contrast, a multinational will have great profits. This is the main conclusion of WWF Hellas' report commenting on YPEKA's Report on drafting the support mechanism of RES, noting that it takes into account only the investors' aims [7] Also, the project will reproduce the industrial mode of energy production, which is based on long distance transmission of energy rather than locally produced decentralized production.",movement-against-industrial-renewable-energy-resources-res-in-chios,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"ISouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) is a British Overseas Territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is a remote collection of islands, consisting of South Georgia and a chain of smaller islands. In 2017, environmental group Great British Oceans: a coalition of six organisations: Blue Marine Foundation, Greenpeace,  Marine Conservation Society, Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), The Zoological Society of London (ZSL); came together demanding the UK government to protect and preserve South Sandwich Islands (Sant Georgia) in the Antarctic [1]. The South Georgia Maritime Zone covers more than one million square kilometres [4]. In particular, the environmentalists called for a ban of all fishing and commercial activity in the sensitive zone since the region is rich wilderness and biodiversity, and as such, needs urgent protection [1]. The environmentalists demanded the islands to be made a sanctuary [2]. It was to be a place for whaling stations. Scientists working in the region, supported the environmentalsits, suggesting that,  right at the northern edge of the Antarctic, they could provide a valuable barometer for the effects of climate change in the region [1] [2].Since 2012, the islands were already part of a marine protected area (MPA), a conservation status that limits the amount of fishing and other human activity [4]. But declaring the area a sanctuary would safeguard the marine environment before climate and other threats harms the area [2]. For instance, Krill reproduction is highly dependent on sea ice conditions and hence environmental factors [4]. The government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (UK) is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the existing conservation measures. An Antarctic researcher from Oxford University who runs the PenguinWatch project, told  that it might be best to wait until that review was complete before declaring the area a sanctuary [2]. But groups supporting the bid, , say that keeping the islands for research will support an effort to understand the impact of climate changes in the wider Southern Ocean region stretching into Antarctica [2].While the extreme environment and remoteness make the islands difficult to study and even to reach, the organisations say ""it is certain that the ecosystem is one of a kind and globally significant"" and, therefore, deserves a full protection [2]. Waters off Antarctica must be protected from fishing and other industries, before is too late [3]. This is especially the case for fishing industry, which threaten the health of animal populations such as penguins, whales, seals, fish and krill [3].",conservation-of-south-sandwich-islands-antarctica,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
