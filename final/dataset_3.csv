"The increasing leather industry in Brazil is killing the local environment. Workers in this industry are impacted by toxins and chemicals; waste disposals are rejected to the rivers and environment. China and India are world leaders in this industry, but in the past few decades, Brazil is increasing its production.  In Icoaraci (State of Belem) more than 130 000 people are exposed to toxic materials due to the leather industry, the firms Fênix Curtidora, Curtume Idea and Curtume Couro Norte are rejecting their toxic materials to the igarapé Piraíba. (An igarapé is a small branch or canal in a river). This toxicity has already been proved by the State Public Ministery and in collaboration with Instituto de Pesquisas Científicas e Tecnológicas do Estado do Pará (IEPA). The leather comes from cattle, sheep, or even alligators. Since 2004, communities have made claims against these enterprises denouncing bad smells, water contamination and some impacts in their health. One of the studies from researchers shows that one toxic element used in the leather preparation process is chromium which is irritant, affecting the upper respiratory tract, obstructing air ducts, and increasing the chances of developing lung, nasal, or sinus cancer. Is linked with asthma, bronchitis, polyps of the upper respiratory tract and pharyngitis. In 2005, because of the pressured by community associations in Icoaraci, the Executive Secretariat of Science, Technology and Environment (SECTAM) sent technicians to inspect the Leather tanneries (Fenix, Ideal and Norte). Due to the results SECTAM began to oversee the activity. After this, University of Pará collaborated with the firms to provide technical solutions to decrease pollution. But, according with the Icoaraci residents (who have fought for many years) the government needs to be stricter in the adoption of measures to combat pollution caused by tanneries in the rivers. In addition to the chemicals, they dennounced animal fat that pollutes and causes intense odor of rotting flesh around and at great distances.",traditional-communities-against-pollution-of-leather-industry-in-belem,SIM,NÃO,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"Fosen Vind is an onshore mega wind project with six wind farms in the Trøndelag County, Central Norway, and one of the to be the biggest  wind power project in Europe with a  capacity of 1GW [2, 5]. However, two of the windfarms Storheia (Åfjord) and Roan (Fosen), are particularly harming Sami reindeer herders , because the farms would be built on their traditional, culturally and environmentally important pastures [2,3]. In concrete, reindeer herders in Norway argued that the sight and sound of wind turbines would frighten off  reindeer grazing  and thus jeopardises age-old traditions. TheSami and  their land and cultures should not be expropriated for such a project [3].Because traditional Sami reindeer herding is a form of protected cultural practice, the ambitious wind project is void according to the country's Supreme court [2,3,4]. Further, ""Their construction has been declared illegal, and it would be illegal to continue operating them,"" a representative of Sami headers stated [2].Since the 2016, when the project started to be planned and soon implemented, Sami people and activists have been protesting against it [4, 5]. The people indicated that the project violates national and international law, including the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; ""Reindeer herding in the Southern Sami area is the bearer of the Southern Sami language and culture,"" one of the activists argued [4]. Then, activists alo mentioned how limiting the size of the winter pastures will make reindeer herding unsustainable [4]. Hence impacted will be forced to give up their cultural heritage and even cultural survival [4].There were two court cases, one after the other[11].  ""A local court of appeal in June 2020 found that the Sámi had lost their grazing land as a result of the two wind parks, and ordered Fosen Vind to pay the herders what was considered a strikingly large sum of money: 90 million NOK (10 million USD) to buy fodder for the animals for the foreseeable future. Interestingly, both the Sámi and Fosen Vind appealed that sentence to the supreme court. For the former it was a matter of principle: they thought the concession was outright illegal as it violates their rights as native people, and found a financial settlement insufficient. Fosen Vind, on the other hand, considered the compensation excessive and disproportionate. The Norwegian government, worried that the case might set a precedent and deter potential foreign investors from applying for wind concessions elsewhere, sided with the joint venture company in its appeal.The Supreme Court has now overturned the local ruling on the grounds that the concessions for the wind farms are invalid and should never have been granted"" (Peroni, [11]). . The judges cited international law, saying that ""in those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist,"" the latter should not be denied the right ""to enjoy their own culture.""[11]. Despite the efforts by Sami people,  the project continued without public consultations willing to hear their concerns, the people took their case all the way to the Supreme Court of Norway [7]. On 11 October 2021, the Supreme Court ruled ""that the wind farm development will have a material negative effect on the reindeer owners' scope for practising their culture in Fosen"". [2,3,4,6,7]. In this decision further, ""the Court of Appeal (had previously) determined a considerable amount of compensation for the winter feeding of penned reindeer and held that the right to cultural enjoyment was thus not encroached upon"" [7].On the other hand, Statkraft company  (backed in practice by the state of Norway, a major shareholder) argued that the added wind energy will be important for increasing the country's electrification and for selling electricity to Europe. ""Renewable production of energy will be increasingly important in the future when fossil fuels are gradually replaced"". According to the company, renewable energy has started to replace fossil fuels in the transportation sector of the country. The country plan, further,  is to export electricity to Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Russia and the Netherlands via cross-border links to other electrical networks [3]. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court  found that Sami rights have been infringed and that the decisions on granting operating licences and expropriation ordinances are therefore invalid [7]. Noway has ratified ILO Convention 169. The Court quoted the ICESCR, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also ratified by Norway.  The court clearly concluded that ""the construction infringes the right to cultural practice, but peoples claim was not upheld in a decision by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in 2013. The matter was brought before the courts and Fosen Vind was still granted permission to commence constructions, and the two wind farms were completed in 2019 and 2020, respectively [7]"".

"In being responsible for 45% of the global trade in palm oil, Wilmar International is the biggest trader worldwide. In 2013, it announced a sustainability policy involving a zero tolerance of deforestation and peat land exploitation, with which all its subsidiaries and suppliers must comply. Further, company received the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RPSO) certification for sustainable production in 2005.   The Kapa and Sasak people are indigenous to the province of Western Sumatra, and their livelihoods are concentrated to the district (Kabupaten) of Pasaman Barat, but to different sub-districts (Kecamatan), namely Luhak Nan Nua and Sasak Ranah Pesistir respectively (1). Despite being closely related, more information is available on the conflict between the Kapa and Wilmar, than on that between the Sasak and Wilmar. Therefore, more reference is here made to the Kapa case.  The conflict between the two indigenous groups and Wilmar dates back to 1997, when the Kapa and Sasak leaders made their customary lands available to the district government (1). This, however, did not involve a formal surrender of Kapa and Sasak rights to their lands. However, PT Permata Hijau Pasamatan 1 (PT PHP1), a subsidiary of Wilmar International, was granted provisional land use rights by the local government for the establishment of oil palm plantations on Kapa territory. When PT PHP1 started its operations, the communities claim not to have been informed about the implications of those. The terms under which the company is using the Kapa and Sasak lands has been a question of dispute since (1; 2; 11).     The land currently covered by PT PHP 1 plantations was previously covered by farmland, mangrove forest peat and swamps in which the villagers collected rattan or fished catfish (1). In 2014, PT PHP1 applied for a Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) – a commercial land lease – from the National Land Agency (BPN) over the Kapa and Sasak territory, without having sought prior consent by the communities. An HGU would, if obtained, grant the company a 35-year-long use right of the land. After the expiration of the permit, the land would be returned to the national government, not the communities. Consequently, Wilmar obtaining an HGU over the territory would deprive the Kapa and Sasak of all rights to the land (3).   According to Indonesian law and the RSPO principles, companies are required to respect customary land rights and not operate on community land unless prior and informed consent has been obtained. As such, the Kapa responded to the HGU application by filing a complaint to the RSPO. The company agreed to discuss the matter with the community members under the presence of representatives from BPN. However, despite agreeing to look into other legal alternatives, the company did not withdraw its application (3).    In March 2015, RSPO released a preliminary decision in the case, stating that the company did not break the law though its HGU application (4). The Kapa leader responded to the decision, and was soon thereafter imprisoned for two months, accused of having mismanaged community funds. However, the Forest Peoples Program (FPP) and other NGOs claim Wilmar to stand behind the charges, which the company denies (5; 6; 7).   In February 2017, however, the RSPO declared that PT PHP1 had violated RSPO principles (8). The RSPO Complaints Panel recommended that the community-company land divisions would be established through participatory mapping to ensure shared community-company benefits, and that legal alternatives to an HGU would be explored based on the mapping results (2; 9). Initially, Wilmar announced its willingness to comply with these recommendations. Later, however, deeming not to have been able to give its input during the process, the company expressed complaints in relation to the way in which the case was handled by the RSPO. The Kapa, Sasak and supporting organizations are now hoping that the RSPO will stick to its 2017 ruling (10)",wilmar-grabs-kapa-indigenous-land,NÃO,SIM,SIM,SIM,SIM
"At the beginning of the 1970s, three electronic power plants were present in Italy: Trino Vercellese, Borgo Sabotino (Latina), and Garigliano. In 1971, the construction of the Caorso (PC) station began. After the energy crisis of 1973, Enel (National Electricity Energy), along with the National Government, decided to improve the use of nuclear energy: in 1975, the first national energy plan was approved with the forecast of twelve new power plants. At this point, a popular opposition movement began in the country. On June 26, 1974, the president of the Lazio Region, Santini, approved the location of a power plant in Alto Lazio, in the coastal strip that includes Montalto di Castro and eleven other municipalities. The same approval came from the CIPE (Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning) and Law 393, of August 2, 1975 [1]. This law established the procedures for locating new power plants and, at the same time, chose a suitable site: an area with a dual vocation, agricultural and tourist. The risk to the economy of both sectors due to the presence of the plant immediately prompted protests from farmers, tourist operators, and residents. An anti-nuclear committee was formed and the first protest initiatives emerged, including the blocking of the Tyrrhenian railroad. The first event, called the ""Festival of Life"", took place on March 20, 1977, in ""Pian Dei Gangani."" 8,000 people from all over Italy participated: peasants (led by Pietro Blasi), political activists, and some scientists. Weapons shelters appeared here with the laughing sun, and the ""mass"" environmental movement was born. In addition to defending the territory and the health of the inhabitants of Montalto and Ecologists, the Student and Youth Movement of '77 added a radical critique of a society increasingly controlled and repressed by political and economic power, and a militarized territory. The anti-nuclear movement in Montalto, like the rest of Italy, was made up of students, associations, and workers (from metalworkers to university professors). Few political parties. The final approval of the plant came at the end of 1977 from the Lazio region and then from the municipality of Montalto di Castro on March 24, 1978 (the municipality initially opposed it, then the mayor resigned and the new mayor succumbed to EEL's pressures). In 1978, the government launched the second pen reducing six power plant constructions (increasing the powers), including that of Montalto. Some scientists founded the ""National Committee for Energy Options Control,"" which organized another demonstration at PIAN DEI GANGANI on May 9, 1978, and then supported the action of local committees, proposing an alternative model based on energy saving and renewable sources. Environmentalists exposed the deceit of the large energy demand to justify the pharaonic plans for offerings. The police and carabinieri, but also the major media, mobilized for the occasion. Several blocks of roads, with dozens of established police mitros, searched almost every car. However, it was a peaceful demonstration. Construction of the plant began in 1979 and continued despite protests and legal initiatives from the Struggle Movement. On May 19, 1979, following the accident at the Three Mile Island plant, the largest environmental event ever held in Rome took place: 40,000 people, coordinated by the National Committee, shouted their objection to nuclear energy. In 1981, the third pen was reduced to four in the number of new power plants, including Montalto. The National Committee continued an intense mobilization throughout Italy in this period, based on assemblies, information campaigns publications that generalized social conflict. The large courtyard and related protests were eventually advanced until 1986, when the reactor of the Chernobyl plant exploded. Legambiente, an association born in 1980 from the meeting of scientists belonging to the anti-nuclear movement, coordinated the blockade of all Italian power plants on October 10, 1986. In many other mobilizations that spontaneously emerged in the last months, there were clashes with the police and numerous arrests. In Rome, 200,000 people stood peacefully in the procession, many of whom were behind Legambiente’s banners and alongside a new institutional theme: the Green Party. The new party played a fundamental role in the anti-nuclear struggle, both outside Parliament, blocking the construction site of Montalto di Castro three times in 1987, and inside, especially after the referendum on November 8-9, 1987. On this occasion, 80% of the Italian population expressed opposition to the production of atomic energy through nuclear fission. However, the government tried to maintain the plant and the ongoing protests. At this point, even the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Association) avoided the Montalto plant thanks to the political pressure exerted by the deputies of the Green Party. On April 21, 1988, the MITA government decided to convert it into a conventional center (using hydrocarbons). The conversion became law in 1989 [2] [3]. The worker, the blood tribute in accidents at the construction site, was three dead and 400 injured.",centrale-elettronucleare-alto-lazio-di-montalto-di-castro,SIM,NÃO,SIM,SIM,SIM
"The strawberry is one of the main crops of the Doñana. With almost 6,000 hectares of farmland, this area produces most Huelva strawberry and about 60% of the strawberries in Spain. At the same time, as it has been shown that production of strawberry is having a severe impact on the quality and quantity of water available for wetlands in the National Park, and connecting with other areas of Doñana value inside. In Doñana, the exploitation of water used for growing strawberries is illegal in about 50% of the fields, because the wells are dug and water is extracted without the necessary permits and licenses. In addition, part of the strawberry fields of the area has been planted in forest areas, occupying and cutting pine public without proper permits. In the past 30 years the contributions of the aquifer to the Rocina creek, one of the main tributaries to the National Park, have fallen by 50%. To this we must add that the spatial distribution of strawberry and associated infrastructure has led to fragmentation of habitats surrounding protected areas, hindering natural corridors for terrestrial wildlife moving in and out of the park. These impacts are compromising the maintenance of biodiversity in Doñana long-term conservation of the most sensitive species today. Doñana is suffering since decades ""stealing water"", which is publicly known since its inception and is collected in different reports and documents since the eighties. Since then it is also known that the theft of water causes a decrease in the levels of reducing groundwater water available to the Doñana National Park and the lakes and rivers of the area as well as for legal users, and that the proliferation of illegal uses prevents proper management of water resources. The direct consequence is the loss of biodiversity, reduction of services that ecosystems provide to society and unfair competition from illegal users to legal. The problems of illegal water use have been reported repeatedly by various international agencies since 1990 (including Doñana in the Montreux Record of the Ramsar Convention) and the National and Andalusian authorities were warned of the urgent need for a solution. But the sense of impunity and lack of governance in the area remains each passing day and illegalities increase. WWF - one of the organisations most involved in fighting against the illegal water use in Doñana -  has identified specific instances of illegality in the use of water in Doñana, in five distinct and very significant areas. Overall there are between 1000 and 2000 illegal water use infrastructures according to different sources. Water is a public good and society can not tolerate the ""water theft"" which causes few breaking the law to obtain benefit at the expense of other legal users of the goods and services provided by ecosystems and the future of the Doñana protected areas.",illegal-boreholes-for-strawberry-farming-in-donana,SIM,NÃO,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"The subsidiaries of Minera Frisco have created a mining latifundium of just over half a million hectares in the municipalities of San Felipe, Mexicali, and Ensenada in Baja California, Mexico, for the open-pit gold mine San Felipe. To date, it is the largest in the consortium. Over 13 years, the farmers of the Ejido Plan Nacional Agrario and the fishermen of the port of San Felipe have confronted the mining company in various ways. This includes denouncing the breach of agreements for the rental of communal ejidal lands to the three subsidiaries operating the mine, demanding fairer payments, and complaints about the illegal use of ejido lands. The communities in the area have accused these companies of polluting the waters of the Sea of Cortes, causing serious health issues for the residents of the port, and demanding a review of the gigantic water concessions given by the federal government to these mining companies. Reporter Celia Guerrero described in 2016 how the San Felipe Mine expanded and the damages it had caused to the population by that year. This conflict between farmers, fishermen, and the subsidiaries of Minera Frisco highlights the true predatory behavior of the magnate Carlos Slim, one of the richest men in the world. Through hundreds of concessions, unfair land rentals, direct dispossession, and buying of consciences, the San Felipe mine has monopolized lands in the Sierra ""La Pinta"" and underground water in the vicinity of the Protected Natural Areas ""Alto Golfo de California"" and ""Delta del Río Colorado"". It has illegally occupied lands of the ejidatarios, contaminated and destroyed fragile ecosystems, and faced resistance from the people through counterclaims ""for breach of agreements"" to the ejidatarios. Minera Frisco has faced persistent resistance from farming and fishing communities, academics, and independent media over time. In early 2021, the ejidatarios blocked the entrance to the mine for several days, demanding fair terms for the rental agreements. The ejidatarios, owners of the 3,500 hectares leased to Grupo Frisco, blocked access to the deposit. They demanded that the new agreement with the subsidiary Minera Real de Ángeles, S.A. DE C.V., be established in dollars. They are demanding a payment of 10,000 dollars for each of the over 200 ejidatarios because the mine earns ""millions of dollars."" ""The government granted them the subsoil, but the land is ours."" ""They have a million-dollar investment, and we are not willing to continue with the same treatment."" Carlos Slim Helú's conglomerate Grupo Carso bought the Mexican government Minera Frisco, S.A.B. de C.V., in 1985. This is a consortium of around 30 subsidiary mining companies that divide the functions of exploration, exploitation, services, and marketing. The history of the accumulation of lands by Minera Frisco began over 30 years ago, but between 2005 and 2011 the consortium increased the land grab and investment to extract more metals. In that last year, Frisco advanced in the exploitation and expansion of its mines, mostly open-pit, to produce and market concentrates of lead, silver, zinc, and copper, and its main source of mining profit, the production of gold and silver doré bars. Frisco first placed shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) in 2011, the year the Slim family increased their mining latifundiums by hundreds of thousands of hectares. Minera Frisco sells its shares on the BMV with the guarantee that it has ""land reserves and mining concessions"" that provide certainty about ""the profitability and growth of the company."" In 2014, Slim's mining consortium produced 423.4 thousand ounces of gold, equivalent to 13.11 percent of the national gold production. The doré bars it produces are sold almost entirely to the United States. Frisco has 10 mines, five of which began metal extraction eight years ago. The Asientos and El Porvenir mines are located in Aguascalientes; El Concheño, Ocampo, and El Coronel in Chihuahua; María in Sonora; San Felipe in Baja California; Tayahua, San Francisco del Oro, and Gloria Estela in Zacatecas. Thirty-seven percent of the territory of the state of Baja California has been granted to the mining consortia, mainly to the Mexican patriarchs Carlos Slim and Germán Larrea, but also to Canadian companies, which have concessions for tens of thousands of hectares. In 2014, the Ministry of Economy reported that in Baja California, there were 464 lots granted to mining companies, equivalent to 896,024.1 hectares. Four years later, the privatization of the Baja California territory increased by 59.5%, rising to 1,505,890.12 hectares granted to mining companies. Of this total, Minera Frisco owns 577,457.3 hectares. Slim has appropriated 22 percent of the surface given by the federal government to mining capital. Minera Frisco increased the concentration of mining latifundiums in Baja California through fraud against the farmers of the Ejido Plan Nacional Agrario in the municipality of Ensenada. The San Felipe mine began operations in 1994, when it leased the communal lands in the area of the Sierra in the municipality of Mexicali to the 214 ejidatarios of the Ejido Plan Nacional Agrario. At that time, the subsidiary Minera San Felipe, S.A. de C.V., paid $71 annually to each ejidatario. In 2010, the Carlos Slim mining company obtained more concessions, and in its quest for complete possession of the Sierra ""La Pinta,"" the consortium's representatives offered $2,000 per hectare to each ejidatario for the purchase of 8,560 hectares. Most of the ejidatarios did not accept this offer, but a minority, bought by the company, did. Frisco now occupies 45,000 hectares of the Ejido Plan Nacional Agrario as ""right-of-way servitudes."" The federal government granted them to the mining company through rigged agreements and paid less money than is due.

"The Tremembé are an indigenous group that inhabits Brazil's northwest State of Ceará. In the XVI century, they occupied an area that spanned from what is nowadays the State Para to Ceará. However, today, they can only be found in four coastal municipalities of this last State. The Tremembé still maintain many of their traditions, especially the Torém dance. Despite having lost most of their land rights in the XIX century, in the past decades they have been strengthening their political organization and struggling for territorial recognition against different economic interests in the region. These interests, who mainly come from agribusiness activities – such as coconut plantations and irrigation projects – and tourism infrastructure, put their already small territory under constant pressure. In the late 70s, Ducoco Agrícola S.A acquired land in an area inhabited by the Tremembé at the sites of Vartoja, Almofala in the Itarema municipality. The company expanded coconut plantations motivated by a higher demand for coconut water and the modernisation of the coconut production process. A couple of years later, Ducoco started invading and displacing the Tremembé from their lands, destroying their houses and plantations and using armed henchmen to threaten the people out of the land. While some families moved to a nearby area, some remained and formed a small hamlet in the mangroves called Villa Ducoco, trapped between the Aracati-Mirim River and the company's plantations. The displacement has stripped the Tremembé of their former means for survival since Ducoco's dispossession deprived them from accessing hunting grounds and land for raising livestock and agriculture. Without means for sustaining themselves, some people ended up as hands for Ducoco, working for a meagre, seasonal salary. The company also hired some Tremembé as security to guarantee the residents of Vila Ducoco wouldn't enter its property, thus turning the indigenous people against each other. Moreover, the company has severely reduced their mobility by denying the Tremembé the right to cross the plantations, thus further fragmenting the territory. They also fear the consequences of the agrochemicals used by Ducoco in underground waters and in the Aracati-Mirim River, which they use as a source of water for consumption. Some of the workers have reported falling ill due to exposure to the fumigated substances.The Tremembé have initiated different lawsuits against Ducoco and have won most of them. The Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) (part of the Basic ecclesial communities movement) has been their strongest ally since the mid-1980s, helping the Tremembé with their political organisation and in obtaining land rights. The FUNAI arrived in 1992 and started the process of land recognition. One year later, the foundation recognised 4900ha to form the ""Tremembé indigenous territory of Almofala"", comprising both the invaded land and those the company had bought. Ducoco currently occupies 30% of the indigenous land. Ducoco and several local actors – such as the Itarema municipality and other political groups – met the creation of the indigenous territory with fierce opposition. These groups have often hindered economic activities by the indigenous people and threatened them with violence. Ducoco started different legal actions against the FUNAI, protesting against land demarcation. While the company always loses in court, it manages to appeal the decision and thus annul its effects.  Until today, however, neither the Ministry of Justice has declared the land's possession by the Tremembé nor did the President of the Republic homologate it.",agribusiness-affecting-indigenous-tremembe-in-ceara,SIM,NÃO,SIM,SIM,SIM
"The stories of Sellafield-Windscale and Chernobyl are intertwined in ways which Brian Wynne unravelled. Sellafield-Windscale is a huge complex of fuel storage ponds, chemical reprocessing plants, nuclear reactors, defunct military piles, plutonium processing and storage facilities, and waste processing and storage silos. It has developed from its original role in   the early 1950s of producing purely weapons-grade plutonium into a combined military and commercial reprocessing facility which stores and reprocesses thousands of tonnes of UK and foreign spent fuel. It is by far the biggest employer in the area, with a regular workforce of some five thousand swollen by a construction workforce of nearly the same size. It dominates the whole area not only economically, but also socially and culturally.   As explained by Brian Wynne (1992), Sellafield-Windscale has been the centre of  accidents and events relating to radiation discharges to the environment and workforce radiation doses, with criticisms not only of allegedly inadequate management and regulation, but also of poor scientific understanding of its environmental effects, and of the economic irrationality of the recycling option in nuclear fuel cycle policy. ""In the early 1980s the plant was alleged to be the centre of excess childhood leukaemia clusters... This controversy continues, with every scientific report exhaustively covered in the local and national media... In 1984 the operators were accused by the environmental group Greenpeace of contaminating local beaches above legal discharge levels, and were subsequently prosecuted; and in 1986 they were threatened with closure after another incident and an ensuing formal safety audit by the Health and Safety Executive. Despite huge investments in public relations, they have suffered a generally very poor public image for openness and honesty over the years.""  Before most of these controversies developed, in 1957 the Sellafield-Windscale site suffered a large accident, when a nuclear pile caught fire and burned for some days before being quenched. It emitted a plume of radioactive isotopes, mainly iodine and caesium, over much the same area of the Lake District of Western Cumbria as that affected by the Chernobyl fallout thirty years later. This fire and its environmental effects were surrounded by a great deal of secrecy. Although farmers in the vicinity were forced to pour away contaminated milk for several weeks afterwards, at the time they reacted without any overt hostility or criticism of the industry. Even in 1977 when they had the opportunity during a public inquiry to join with an emergent coalition of various forces against a major expansion at Sellafield, the local farming population largely kept out of the argument. The work force at Sellafield was seen as an economic bonus by the farming population.  It  was only after 1987 that the fuller extent of the Windscale fire cover-up emerged into the public domain.  After the Chernobyl accident of April 1986, in Britain upland areas got heavy variable deposits of radioactive caesium isotopes, which were rained out by localized thunderstorms. The effects of this radioactive fallout were immediately dismissed by scientists and political leaders as negligible, but on 20 June 1986, a ban was suddenly placed on the movement and slaughter of sheep from some of these areas, including Cumbria.  At the time over four thousand British farms were restricted. The initially wide restricted area in Cumbria (which included about five hundred farms) was whittled dawn within three months to a central crescent covering one hundred and fifty farms.  Very close to this central 'crescent' of longer-term radioactive contamination, almost suggesting itself as its focal point, is the Sellafield-Windscale nuclear complex.   One of the farmers interviewed by Brian Wynne said: ""They talk about these things coming from Russia, but it's surely no coincidence that it's gathered  around Sellafield. They must think everyone is completely stupid"". And another farmer ventured this explanation: ""Quite a lot of farmers around believe it's from Sellafield and not from Chernobyl at all. In 1957 it was a Ministry of Defence establishment-they kept things under wraps-and it was maybe much more serious than they gave out. Locals were drinking milk, which should probably never have been allowed -and memory lingers on.""     Many years later, there are powerful interests (including local unions in Sellafield, representing 9000 workers,  and the local Labour MP) in favour of turning Sellafield into even more of a nuclear waste dump. As reported in 2013 (Financial Times, Jan 30), Lord Hutton, Chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, favoured disposal in Cumbria. He said that  ""The issue of what to do with our nuclear waste has not gone away"". But he was confident other places would be available. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, expected the programme to manage radioactive waste safely to be ultimately be successful. However, he rejected calls by Copeland, the area that is home to Sellafield nuclear plant, and where most of the waste is stored temporarily, to be allowed to go it alone. He said both district and county authorities had to agree and Cumbria county councillors were clearly against it, because of  public opposition. ""Tens of thousands have campaigned against hosting the dump, saying it would ruin the Lake District's tourism industry and threaten health"".",windscale-sellafield-uk,NÃO,SIM,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA

History of the conflict The project of the mine El Cerrejón started in 1975, when the Colombian government invited 17 firms to participate to the tender for the exploitation of the 32,000 hectares of coal in northern Colombia, in the department of la Guajira, which now constitutes the Cerrejón Zona Norte area. The following year the national company Carbones de Colombia S.A. (Carbocol) and Intercor, a branch of Exxon, signed an association contract for 33 years, which was extended in 1999 for 25 more, until 2034. In 2000 Carbocol sold the 50% of its shares in Cerrejón Zona Norte to a consortium formed by two subsidiaries of Billiton Company, a subsidiary of Anglo American, and a subsidiary of Glencore, which formed the company Cerrejón Zona Norte S.A. In 2002 the three companies also acquired the remaining 50% from Intercor, thus becoming the sole owners and shareholders of Carbones del Cerrejón Limited. In 1983 the Government of Colombia issued a concession to Carbocol relative to some shore areas and beaches in Bahía Portete (Guajíra), and authorized the construction and operation of Puerto Bolívar, the most important port for coal in Latin America, with an initial capacity to receive ships for 180,000 tons. Clearly the mining exploitation supposed an important development, as it established an infrastructure that while responding to the production objectives of El Cerrejón, it would also impact substantially the human and natural environments surrounding it. After six years, and an investment of 3,000 million dollars, the construction and installation of infrastructures in the El Cerrejón Zona Norte area was finalized and the mining operation commenced on a great scale. The Colombian Government left the structure completely in the hands of foreign capital, not only with regards to its administrative, structural, and financial aspects, but also including rights on all the territory that such exploitation embraced, while historically these hosted different tribes of the Wayuu people, some afro-descendent tribes, as well as farmers and citizen of half the department (11.000 km2). Despite the creation of the System of Cerrejón Foundations in 2008, the occupation and expansion of El Cerrejón caused the forced displacement of entire populations. In 1983, for instance, while El Cerrejón sought expansion of its infrastructures and was growing uncontrolled, much of the ancestral territory of the community of Wayuu of Media Luna was overtaken to build the carbon stocking port. In order to find an appropriate compensation that could allow the relocation of the locals and the transport of the cemeteries, the mining company and the local community were confronted in a fierce discussion, which even entailed physical and verbal threats. The community, however, finally surrendered without fulfilling any of its expectations. Similarly, in 1991 the communities of Caracolí and Espinal, composed by more than 1000 hectares where 350 Wayuu people lived, were destroyed and relocated. The biggest spoil, up to this moment, happened in 2001, when the company Intercor and local authorities forced several afro-colombian families, approximately 1,200 people living in Tabaco, out of their territories,. Mining activities account for 14.2 % of the GDP of la Guajira. Other activities such as commerce or services only amount to 0.7 % and 1 %, respectively. Traditional activities like agriculture, breeding, or fishing, have shrunk starkly due to the expansion of the mining industry, which now uses the lands that were previously destined to these practices. The food sovereignty of the population, therefore, is substantially affected. Environmental contamination of lands, air, and water also affected the health of those populations living close to the mine. The gas emissions, indeed, caused grave conflict, since the gases of coal self-combustion even rise when it rains. In every leak that opens spontaneously carbon fires up, and this generates sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and carbon gas, among other substances. The mining especially and irreversibly affected a fundamental element of the ecological structure: the rivers. The river Ranchería is the main watercourse in an area that would otherwise be desert, providing the refill of aquifers deep until levels of rock and deposits. The course of the Ranchería has allegedly been deteriorated, and its hydrogen cycle was also affected due to deforestation and impact of the project in the area. Other rivers and watercourses have been modified, such as the Aguas Blancas and the Tabaco rivers. Despite the fact that the company monitors the effluents of water from domestic, industrial and residual waters, the reality is that in times of rain one can fin effluents with traces of ammonium nitrate from the explosives factory, or residual waters of the washing of equipment contaminated with grease, oils, fuel traces, and coal. The increase in the magnitude of the operations implied the enhancement of their effects on the environment. Conversely, contention measures were not improved, as the worsening environmental conditions served the purpose to displace affected communities. On top of the contamination of the few existing water sources of the area, El Cerrejón also aims at attacking directly the Ranchería river. The expansion project would in fact need to move the river approximately 25 Km, in order to gain access to 500 million tons of coal located underneath its course. Even if this particular project is temporarily paralyzed, another one is now directly threatening other two minor affluent rivers of the Ranchería. The role of the Architecture of Impunity The cooperation between Colombian institutions and the corporation is very close. This not only opens the gate to corruption, but also hampers legislative reforms that may serve the interests of the affected communities. The vice-Minister of Mining, for example, who was responsible for the reform of the country's Mining Code in 2001, was also the sales director of Carbocol. This is but one example of the revolving doors pattern that was established. With regard to investment and trade agreements, these instruments gradually conceded to transnational companies political and trading power that allowed them to grow steadily, as well as different fiscal benefits. The boundaries between the State and the transnational companies operating in the country became blurred, especially in the department of Guajira and in El Cerrejón, where the companies assumed complete control of the economy of the whole area, thus affecting key sectors like local infrastructures, education, and health. At the same time, the military and police structures in those areas are now devoted to the protection of the interests of transnational corporations, and are therefore curtailing the freedom of movement of local communities. Since 1997, and with the pretext of fostering some Corporate Social Responsibility programs, the associated companies Carbocol-Intercor have been proposing to the population of Tabaco to accept a lump sum in exchange for their eviction and cession of their rights over the territory. This proposal obviously divided the community between those who sold and left, and those who resisted and looked for a relocation of the population with the aim of preserving their social unity and the desire to continue with a common destiny, hence preserving common traditions of agriculture and breeding allowing them to survive. To evict those who did not accept the compensation offered, the company exerted strong pressures like the suspension of public services in the houses, the burning of cemeteries and houses, prohibitions of transit in the area, the distraction of the watercourse from the river in benefit of the company's needs, and the eviction of some families – with the support of the Public Forces and in presence of the Public Attorney. It is estimated that investment accumulated in social compensations to the Wayuu communities since 1982 until 2002 was about 5 million dollars in indexed prices for 2002, a sum that represents a production of coal of two and a half days. Attempts to access justice There are actually more than 25 judicial proceedings of different nature in Riohacha and Bogota (popular actions, civil claims for remedy and reparation, criminal suits), both against the State and the company, which are connected to the conflict. Many of them were archived in different phases, or are awaiting judgment in the slow judicial system. None of these actions has strengthened or improved the protection of the rights of the victims. In May 2002 the Supreme Court ordered the Township Mayor of Hatonuevo (Guajira) to rebuild Tabaco in an adequate place, but the judgment that protects the rights of the former inhabitants of the bygone Tabaco still lays unapplied. Amidst the arguments in the proceeding there are medical reports from the company documenting the intoxication of workers with silicon dioxide, coal dust and other chemicals, as well as auditory contamination. The Public Prosecutor also mentioned scientific reports from the World Health Organization's Agency for Research on Cancer, which establishes that ""crystalline SILICE is classified in Group 1, this is, carcinogenic for human beings"". The company Carbones del Cerrejón Ltd. acknowledges the presence of caesium 137 and the Ministry of Social Protection (Technical Counsel Axe 5, Labour Hazards) has among its findings the presence of lid, copper, iron and manganese in quantities way above the permitted standards in many areas of work, as well as the presence of 364 different chemicals. The case of the afro-colombian community of Tabaco was reported again in 2007 before the OECD National Contact Points of Australia and Switzerland, in a process of cooperation between municipalities, the company and the community; the community, nevertheless, after 13 years today continues to be in a status of displacement, has not been relocated, and their rights have not been integrally restored. These conflicts have been documented and dealt with by different organizations and investigators. In particular, there exists much worry for the deficiencies regarding public health, labour safety, biodiversity loss, hydrogen cycle disruption and irresponsibility of the company. What justice could do: an opinion from the PPT In a hearing that was held in Geneva in June 2014, the Permanent People's Tribunal (PPT) listened to the testimonies of the Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restrepo and Ask Switzerland, in coordination with affected communities. In line with the evidence brought before the judges by this witness, the Tribunal recognized the actions of the transnational corporation as another example of violations of human and people rights. In line with its full judgement of Madrid, in May 2010, and just a few months before the session that was subsequently held in Mexico in December 2014, the PPT underlined once again how transnational corporations, including those involved in El Cerrejón, systematically violate human and peoples' rights to their own profit. In the same line, the PPT recognized in this widespread practice the current shortcoming of international law, namely the impossibility of accessing justice and obtaining a remedy that is increasingly becoming an unbearable burden for affected communities, as well as for the laws that are supposed to give them shelter. In the same spirit, the PPT acknowledged the necessity to improve international legislation, including through a binding treaty on transnational corporations, and/or a peoples' treaty, in order to hold transnational corporations accountable for their actions. (En Español) Resumen del conflicto Las empresas involucradas en el conflicto son las sociedades Carbones del Cerrejón Limited y Cerrejón Zona Norte S.A., ambas propiedad a partes iguales de compañías filiales de Anglo American PLC (Gran Bretaña), BHP Billiton PLC (Australia) y Glencore PLC (Suiza). Entre los hechos y acciones que motivan el conflicto se encuentra la contaminación ambiental que afecta a los trabajadores de la empresa y a los habitantes de la zona de influencia, tanto de la mina como del puerto, causadas por el polvillo de carbón y otros químicos, elementos y materiales o productos provenientes de las diferentes actividades adelantadas en la mina y el puerto. De igual manera se denuncian irregularidades laborales como las horas de exposición de los trabajadores a la contaminación ambiental y a la contaminación auditiva derivada del ruido generado por la maquinaria. Historia del conflicto El proyecto de la mina El Cerrejón se inició en el año 1975, cuando el Gobierno colombiano invitó a 17 firmas a participar en la licitación para la explotación de carbón de 32.000 hectáreas ubicadas en el extremo norte de Colombia, en el departamento de La Guajira, que actualmente componen el Cerrejón Zona Norte. El año siguiente, la empresa estatal Carbones de Colombia S.A. (Carbocol) e Intercor, filial de Exxon, firmaron un contrato de asociación por 33 años, el cual fue extendido en 1999 por 25 años más, hasta 2034. En el año 2000, Carbocol vendió el 50 % de su participación en Cerrejon Zona norte al consorcio integrado por dos subsidiarias de Billiton Company, una subsidiaria de Anglo American y una subsidiaria de Glencore, que conformaron la Sociedad Cerrejón Zona Norte S.A. En el año 2002, las tres empresas adquirieron el 50 % restante a Intercor, convirtiéndose así en dueños únicos por partes iguales de Carbones del Cerrejón Limited, cuyos accionistas son subsidiarias de las tres compañías antes mencionadas. Ya en 1983, el Gobierno de Colombia otorgó en concesión a Carbocol unas zonas de playa y terrenos de bajamar en Bahía Portete (Guajira) y autorizó la construcción y operación de Puerto Bolívar, el puerto carbonífero más importante de América Latina, con capacidad inicial para recibir barcos de hasta 180.000 t. de peso muerto. Claramente la explotación minera presentaba un importante crecimiento histórico, estableciendo una infraestructura que si bien responde a los objetivos de producción de El Cerrejón, representaría un evidente impacto en los entornos naturales y humanos. Después de seis años, y con una inversión de 3.000 millones de dólares, se finalizó la etapa de construcción y montaje de las instalaciones e infraestructura de El Cerrejón Zona Norte que dio inicio a la operación de minería en gran escala. El estado colombiano dejó en manos del capital extranjero no solo el componente administrativo, de infraestructura y financiero de El Cerrejón, sino también todo el territorio en el cual se presenta dicha explotación, que históricamente corresponde a los diferentes clanes Wayuu, algunas comunidades afrodescendientes, campesinos y ciudadanos de más de la mitad del departamento (11.000 Km2). A pesar de la creación en 2008 del Sistema de Fundaciones Cerrejón, internamente se puede observar que la ocupación y expansión de El Cerrejón ha generado el desplazamiento de poblaciones enteras. Por ejemplo, en el año 1983, mientras El Cerrejón buscaba la ampliación de su infraestructura y crecía sin control, gran parte del territorio ancestral de la comunidad wayuu de Media Luna fue usurpado para construir el Puerto de Embarque de Carbón. La empresa minera y la comunidad se enfrentaron, en una negociación de fuertes discusiones y amenazas físicas, para lograr una justa indemnización que permitiera la reubicación de los locales y el traslado de los cementerios. La comunidad cedió finalmente, sin tener éxito en sus expectativas. De igual manera fueron destruidas y reubicadas en 1991 las comunidades Caracolí y Espinal, que comprendían 1000 hectáreas de tierras y donde vivían 350 personas wayuu. El despojo más grande, hasta ahora, tuvo lugar en agosto de 2001 cuando la compañía Intercor y las autoridades locales obligaron a salir de su territorio a familias afrocolombianas, aproximadamente mil doscientas personas que habitaban en el corregimiento de Tabaco. La minería aporta el 14,2 % del PIB de la Guajira. Actividades como el comercio o los servicios representan solo el 0,7 % y el 1 % respectivamente. Las actividades tradicionales, como el cultivo de alimentos, el pastoreo de los animales, o la pesca han disminuido por la expansión de la industria minera, que utiliza los terrenos anteriormente destinados a estas prácticas. La soberanía alimentaria de la población, por tanto, se ve severamente afectada. La contaminación ambiental de los suelos, del aire y del agua afectó también la salud de las poblaciones vecinas de la mina. La emisión de gases constituye un grave conflicto, debido a que los gases de la auto-combustión del carbón, aumentan cuando hay lluvias. En todos los tajos abiertos de manera espontánea se prenden mantos de carbón y generan óxidos de azufre, óxidos de nitrógeno y gas carbónico, entre otros. La minería afectó especialmente y de manera irreversible un elemento fundamental de la estructura ecológica: los ríos. El río Ranchería es el principal cuerpo de agua de una zona por demás desértica, donde la recarga de acuíferos se da desde estos hacia niveles profundos de roca y depósitos. Se presume que ha existido un deterioro de la cuenca del río Ranchería y se ha afectado el ciclo hidrológico debido a la deforestación e intervención del proyecto en el área. Se han modificado arroyos y cuerpos de agua, como por ejemplo el arroyo Aguas Blancas y el arroyo Tabaco. A pesar de que la empresa tiene un monitoreo de los efluentes de aguas residuales domésticas e industriales, la realidad es que en épocas de lluvia se presentan efluentes con trazas de nitrato de amonio de la planta de explosivos, aguas residuales de la planta de lavado de equipos con contenidos de grasas, aceites, trazas de combustible y carbón mineral. Aumentar la magnitud de las operaciones implicó aumentar los efectos sobre el medio ambiente implícitos en ella. No se aumentaron las disposiciones de contención porque se utilizaron como medida de presión para desplazar a las comunidades. Además de la contaminación de las pocas fuentes fluviales ya existente, en la actualidad El Cerrejón pretende atacar de manera directa el río Ranchería. El proyecto de expansión necesitaría trasladar el río por aproximadamente 25 km para así acceder a las 500 millones de tonelada de carbón ubicadas en su cauce. Aunque este proyecto está paralizado actualmente, otro proyecto paralelo amenaza dos afluentes más pequeños del río. El papel de la Arquitectura de la Impunidad La cooperación entre las instituciones colombianas y la empresa son muy estrechas. Esto no solo abre paso a la corrupción sino que además obstaculiza reformas legislativas que puedan servir los intereses de las comunidades afectadas. Por ejemplo, la viceministra de Minas, quién fue responsable de la reforma del código minero en 2001, fue también directora de ventas de Carbocol. Es tan solo un ejemplo del patrón de 'puertas giratorias' establecido. Los acuerdos de inversión económica y tratados de comercio, además de los beneficios fiscales, han concedido un poder comercial y político de crecimiento constante a las empresas transnacionales. Los límites entre Estado y empresas transnacionales se han vuelto borrosos, especialmente en el departamento de la Guajira y el caso del Cerrejón; la empresa ha asumido el control de una economía de enclave incidiendo en sectores de infraestructura, de educación y de salud. Al mismo tiempo, las estructuras militares están dirigidas hacia la protección de los intereses de las empresas transnacionales e impiden el derecho a la libre circulación de las comunidades. Desde el 1997, las empresas asociadas Carbocol-Intercor han propuesto a los pobladores de Tabaco, bajo el pretexto de programas de Responsabilidad Social Empresarial, entregarles una cierta cantidad de dinero para que individualmente desalojen y cedan los derechos sobre el territorio. Esta propuesta divide a la comunidad entre los que vendieron y se fueron, y los que se resisten y buscan una reubicación de la población, con el ánimo de conservar su unidad social y el deseo de continuar con un destino común, conservando las tradiciones agrícolas y ganaderas que les han permitido sobrevivir. Para desalojar a los que no aceptaron la compensación ofrecida, la empresa utilizó presiones como la suspensión de los servicios públicos y domiciliarios, quema del cementerio y viviendas, prohibición del tránsito en el territorio, desvío del agua del río en beneficio de la compañía, desalojo con apoyo de la Fuerza Pública y en presencia de funcionarios de la Fiscalía. Además, se estima que la inversión acumulada desde 1982 a 2002 en compensaciones sociales a las comunidades wayuu ha sido cercana a 5 millones de dólares en precios constantes del 2002, que representa tan solo la producción de carbón de dos días y medio. Intentos de acceso a la justicia Existen más de 25 procesos jurídicos de diferente índole (acciones de tutelas, acciones populares, acciones de reparación, etc.) contra el Estado y contra la empresa ante distintos tribunales en Riohacha y Bogotá. Muchos de ellos fueron denegados en las distintas instancias o se encuentran en demora procesal en el sistema jurídico. Ninguna de las acciones ha fortalecido la protección de los derechos de las víctimas afectadas. Además, en mayo de 2002, la Corte Suprema de Justicia ordenó al Alcalde Municipal de Hatonuevo (Guajira) reconstruir Tabaco en un lugar adecuado, pero el fallo que tutela los derechos de los pobladores del desaparecido Tabaco no se ha cumplido. Entre los argumentos de la demanda se encuentran informes médicos de la empresa que documentan la afectación de los trabajadores con sílice libre, polvo de carbón y otras sustancias químicas, así como contaminación auditiva (ruido). La Procuraduría cita informes científicos de la World Health Organization Agency for Research on Cancer que establecen que 'el sílice cristalino es clasificado en el Grupo 1, es decir, Carcinógeno para humanos'. La empresa Carbones del Cerrejón Ltd. acepta la presencia de cesio 137 y el Ministerio de Protección Social (Asesoría Técnica Eje 5. Riesgos Profesionales) tiene entre sus hallazgos presencia de plomo, cobre, hierro y manganeso que superan los niveles permisibles en algunas zonas de trabajo y reporta presencia de 364 sustancias químicas. El caso de la comunidad afrocolombiana de Tabaco fue denunciado de nuevo en 2007 ante los Puntos Nacionales de Contacto de Australia y Suiza de la OCDE en un proceso de concertación entre municipio, empresa y comunidad; no obstante, la comunidad sigue hoy en día, luego de 13 años, en estado de desplazamiento, no ha sido reubicada y sus derechos no han sido reparados integralmente. Estos conflictos han sido documentados y tratados por diferentes organizaciones e investigadores, En particular, existe preocupación por deficiencias en salud pública, en seguridad laboral, la pérdida de biodiversidad, la afectación al ciclo hidrológico y la irresponsabilidad de la empresa. Lo que la justicia podría hacer: una opinión del TPP En la sesión en Ginebra de junio, 2014, el Tribunal Permanente de los Pueblos (TPP) escuchó el testimonio de miembros del Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restrepo y Ask Suiza, en coordinación con las comunidades afectadas. De acuerdo a lo expuesto ante los jueces del tribunal, éste reconoció las acciones de la corporación transnacional como otro ejemplo de violaciones de derechos humanos y de los pueblos. De acuerdo a la sentencia de Madrid, en mayo de 2010, y unos meses antes de la sesión que tuvo lugar en México en Diciembre 2014, el TPP resaltó de nuevo cómo las corporaciones trasnacionales, incluidas las implicadas en El Cerrejón, violan sistemáticamente estos derechos para su propio beneficio. El tribunal reconoció en esta extendida práctica la evidente limitación del derecho internacional. La imposibilidad del acceso a la justicia y a obtener remediación está convirtiéndose en una carga cada vez mayor para las comunidades afectadas, así como las leyes que deberían protegerlas. Así mismo, el TPP reconoció la necesidad de mejorar la legislación internacional, incluyendo un tratado vinculante para las corporaciones transnacionales y un Tratado de los Pueblos, para que así estas empresas sean consecuentes con sus acciones.",el-cerrejon-mine-colombia,SIM,NÃO,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA
"The company arrived in 1967, as Aracruz Florestal, and started to occupy lands and plant eucalyptus in the municipality of Aracruz, later on in the 1970s in Sao Mateus and Conceicao da Barra.

"Inhabitants of the Itelmen village Kovran in Kamchatka Krai objected in 2008 to the industrial fishery on the Kovran river. The Itelmencouncil Tkhsanom appealed to the Association of Indigenous Peoples ofthe North, Siberia and the Far East for help. The massive fishing will drain the stock of smelt fish. In March of 2008 the Kamchatka Minrybprom (Fishery Ministry) considered that the industrial fishing limits on the ovran river were possible. But a month later Roskomrybolovstvo, the Russian Fishery Committee made a competition for fishing sitdes distribution [1]. Often the indigenous  rights to  fishing  resources in    Kamchatka   are   violated    by   the government  or  commercial companies  who   grab  the   traditional   indigenous peoples'  fishing grounds,  practise  an inequitable     distribution     of    fishing  quotas   which  favours   big   business, and   develop   unfair  legislation   that  restricts the  indigenous  peoples' rights on fishing. The Itelmen community of Kovran is located on the  Sea of Okhotsk coast. Itelmens are the most ancient   people    in    Kamchatka. The oldest settlements discovered by archaeologists show that Itelmens have lived in Kamchatka   for about 15000 years.[2]. Since ancient times the main occupation of the Itelmens was salmon and smelt fishing, and fish has traditionally been a year-round source of nutrition. In  summer,  the Itelmens  used  to catch  and  dry the  fish,  and  sour   it  in   special   pits for   the   long  winter     ahead.  For    smelt     fishing, they would use traps that woukd catch thefish without human intervention  Fish was fed also o dogs, historically the only form   of    local    transportation. Their    main    holiday was   spring    celebrations    when   the first   salmon   appeared  in   the   rivers,  followed,   in   the  fall,   by the Alhalalalay holiday to thank the Earth for its gifts. The Itelmens   have  lived   across the whole  Kamchatka Peninsula. Due to conflicts, diseases and assimilation into the Russian Empire and   the   Soviet  Union,   the   Itelmens' population declined dramatically over  time. Kovran   village was   a  centre for     the     forcible  resettlement of indigenous   population  in   the   Soviet  regime. Some years after the end of the Soviet Union in 1990, the village teamed     up      with      the    regionall government to establish a traditional territory,    called   ""Thsanom"",    which became   the   first  official   territory in Russia    specially    designed for development of indigenous  peoples'   traditional     economy,  culture and  governance. Based on that experience, the   Federal   Government  of   Russia later   developed  the special federal law   ""On    territories    of traditional nature use of  small-numbered     indigenous     peoples of the Russian  North,   Siberia  and   the  Far East"". Later this was disbanded [2].",right-to-fish-in-kamchatka-region,SIM,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"In 1608, Captain John Smith sailed up the Anacostia River, and thus began the industrialization of the river and surrounding areas that have polluted it ever since. In the 18th century, a port was established on the river at its mouth at Bladensburg, Maryland, and the area only continued to be developed. The river was soon polluted by shipbuilding at the Washington Navy Yard and an upriver coal gasification plant [10]. The Washington Navy Yard was classified by the EPA as a Superfund site in 1998 [9]. By 2000, approximately 70% of the watershed had been developed [19]. Since the beginning of the industrialization of the Anacostia, it has faced numerous issues, namely stormwater runoff and urban waste pollution. About 25% of the watershed is covered by impervious surfaces, causing storm water to flow into the river rather than sink into the ground [17]. Runoff brings sediment, toxins, heavy metals, agricultural waste, trash, fecal bacteria, oil, antifreeze, and other pollutants into the river, while also accelerating currents, eroding the banks and increasing sedimentation [19]. The National Resources Defense Council estimates that 75-90% of pollution in the Anacostia is caused by stormwater runoff [7]. Another source of pollution is D.C.'s outdated sewage system, which allows about half a billion gallons of raw sewage to flow into the Anacostia each year. As a result, the river is laden with fecal bacteria, at levels which measure many times more toxic than permitted by public health standards [15]. Before the Clean Water Act passed in 1972, the Anacostia served as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Long-lasting toxins remain in the sediment today, and there are six known ""legacy toxic sites"" in the Anacostia [12]. Toxins still flow into the river from old sites of development as well [8]. These toxins include pharmaceuticals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals. These contaminants are destructive to fish and to all organisms that eat them, disrupting and affecting the food chain and ecosystem of the river [19]. The Anacostia is also littered with trash. It is the second U.S. river declared to be ""impaired by trash"" [12]. Another issue faced by the river is wetland destruction, as 96% of tidal wetlands in the watershed have been destroyed. Wetlands are essential for ecosystem health, and their absence degrades the water quality [9].  The destruction of the Anacostia River is an environmental justice issue as the communities through which it flows are predominantly populated by low-income people of color [11]. The Anacostia meets the Potomac River in D.C., and the Potomac flows primarily through communities of wealthy white people. The Potomac River was once just as degraded as the Anacostia. However, in the 1960s, efforts were made to clean the Potomac, and today it is described as healthy [5]. Even though the Potomac is faster flowing than the Anacostia, and is therefore less susceptible to pollution, it has received extensive attention and assistance while the Anacostia remains polluted. Ironically, the Anacostia feeds into the Potomac, thus its pollution goes into the Potomac albeit in diluted form [11]. Today, the Potomac is a popular tourist destination that houses many landmarks on its waterfront, while the Anacostia has been nicknamed ""the forgotten river"" [4]. The people living by the Anacostia are disproportionately affected by its contamination. In the mid 20th century, when pools were segregated, many African American people swam in the Anacostia instead. In addition to the numerous drownings that occurred, additional dangers arose from the fact that the river was already dangerously contaminated by that time [18]. Additionally, in 2012, a study found that over 17,000 people rely on subsistence fishing in the Anacostia, and though these fish are toxic to eat, many people cannot afford other options [14]. The river also releases a foul smell [11]. While the wealthy white people who live near the Potomac are able to enjoy the river as a green space and place of recreation, the Anacostia is unable to offer these things. Many people are unable to access the river due to obstruction by highways, train tracks, fences, and contaminated land. In 2003, only two out of the fifteen communities bordering the Anacostia were able to access it. In many places, it is only reachable by car or bicycle, which makes it inaccessible to those who cannot afford these transportation methods [4]. Since the late 1980s, efforts have been made to clean up the Anacostia. The Anacostia Watershed Society (AWS), a local NGO, has been working to clean the river with a goal of fishable and swimmable waters by 2025 [9]. In 2009, they installed a trash trap at Nash Run, a stream that feeds into the Anacostia. Between February 2009 and June 2011, the trap captured about 3,300 pounds of trash [10]. In 1998, former D.C. mayor Anthony Williams formed the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI). The AWI's Framework Plan was intended to economically rejuvenate the area. However, the Framework Plan focused primarily on developing the West side of the river, which is a wealthy, white area of D.C. The East side, a low-income, predominantly African American area of D.C., was not developed. Yards Park and Nationals Stadium are two developments on the West side of the river instigated by the Framework Plan. Though intended to economically bolster the area, these sites are largely unaffordable and inaccessible to residents of Southeast D.C. Not only did communities on the East side of the river not benefit, they were actually harmed, as these developments inadvertently caused housing prices to rise in Southeast D.C. In 2001, the AWI began renovations on the Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg Public Housing Project. The intention was to mitigate effects of gentrification, but that did not occur. Complexes were torn down and new ones have yet to be completed. Some units were completed but were situated in areas with contaminated soil. Furthermore, many low-income housing units are inaccessible to truly low-income people, as the median income in D.C. is so high that it skews the data. Despite, and perhaps because of the AWI's efforts, the river remains a symbolic dividing line between both the poor and the rich and white people and people of color in Washington D.C.  In 2009, D.C. passed the Anacostia River Cleanup and Protection Act, which added a five-cent tax to plastic bags, in an effort to reduce litter. This has been largely successful [4]. In 2011, Earthjustice won a court case requiring the EPA to set reasonable limits on pollution from sewage and storm water overflow systems [15]. In 2011, D.C. Water began its Clean Rivers Project, a plan to control sewage overflow. The Blue Plains and Anacostia River Tunnels were completed in March of 2018. These first seven miles divert sewage from the river, and in 2018, the tunnels prevented 4.6 billion gallons of sewage and 900 tons of trash from entering the Anacostia, having been redirected to the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. The Northeast Boundary Tunnel is the next section, and it is slated to be complete by 2023 and will add approximately 90 million gallons of storage [1]. In 2016, laws prohibiting Styrofoam went into effect in Prince George's County, Montgomery County, and D.C. In 2018, the Anacostia passed the AWS's annual State of the River Report Card, with a D- grade; this was the first year it did not fail. Scores for fecal bacteria, water clarity, and chlorophyll all improved, likely as a result of D.C. Water's work improves sewage output. Sewage overflows were down by 40% in 2009 and 60% in 2011. Submerged aquatic vegetation has reappeared in the river, meeting the AWS's goal of 20 acres of coverage. However, in 2019, the Anacostia failed the same report. The AWS remains optimistic, stating that this is likely a result of dissolved oxygen depletion due to extreme weather [19]. In October 2020, the city of DC released their game plan for river clean up, addressing the areas with the highest contamination and hoping to clean 77 acres, which would reduce health risks from contamination by 90% [20]. The next step is to acquire the appropriate permits, with hopes to break ground over the next few years in order to clean up the watershed, protect the environment, and improve the lives of the community.",anacostia-river-environmentally-degraded-by-pollution-and-urban-waste-usa,SIM,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"The Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean oil pipeline (ESPO pipeline, Russian: Нефтепровод ""Восточная Сибирь - Тихий океан"" (ВСТО)) is a pipeline system for exporting Russian crude oil to the Asia-Pacific markets (Japan, China and Korea). The pipeline is built and operated by Russian pipeline company Transneft. The 4,857-kilometre (3,018 mi) pipeline is being laid by the route of Taishet-Kazachinskoye-Skovorodino-Kozmino. On 29 May 2003, Russia and China signed an agreement on construction of the pipeline. Construction of the pipeline started in April 2006. The first stage of the pipeline was completely laid in May 2009 and the whole first stage was reversed in December 2009. According to the initial project the pipeline route was planned in 800 meters from lake Baikal. For this project, the new Water Code of Russian Federation was approved. The Water Code eliminated the 11th article, which established the Water Protection Zone of Lake Baikal and prohibited the pipeline construction. After the final decision on the construction of the pipeline was announced (March 2004) Irkutsk NGO ""Baikal Environmental Wave"" appealed to the court. Environmentalists argue that no public discussion of the project has been conducted, there were no materials on the public examination. Public hearings were held in 2004, in which the EIA go deemed insufficient. Russian environmental organizations sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which point to irregularities in the conduct of state environmental review of the project. In the year 2005 UNESCO expert draws attention to the high risks associated with the project The protests against the pipeline construction near Baikal took place in the year 2006 in 13 cities including Moscow after the beginning of the pipeline construction. Most of the protests were organized by ""Greenpeace Russia"". The largest protest (about 6 thousand people) took place in Irkutst – the city near Baikal lake. During the year 2006 there have been a large number of protests in Russia (most of them in Siberia), several official letters were sent to the President of the Russian Federation to reconsider the project, which finally had to do so. The pipeline had to be shifted to the north. The company Transneft submitted that it will increase the project costs about a billion dollars. On April 26, 2006 the decision was announced. Despite this, for some time the protests continued (for the complete termination of the project), but they were ignored.",the-pipeline-eastern-siberia-pacific-ocean,SIM,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"The anti-nuclear conflict in Erdeven started in1974 when the French government and Électricité de France (EDF) announced to build a nuclear power plant in the eponymous little town. Erdeven is a 4000 inhabitants village located in Morbihan department in the Brittany region, situated in the northwest of France, near the Atlantic Ocean. In this department and especially in Erdeven, the population is a rural population mainly composed of sheperds and farmers that were poorly informed let alone consulted about the nuclear power plant proposal. On the other hand, the former CEO of EDF, Marcel Boiteux had as a plan to develop 13 new nuclear power plants in France [1]. One of the selected areas that matching the siting criteria was Erdeven.This conflict is about the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Erdeven: In 1974, the ""Messmer plan"" was put in place with the following objective: the construction of 200 brand new nuclear reactors in France, one of them being in the small city of Erdeven, in Brittany. This plan was put in place as a solution to the 1973 oil crisis [2]. At this time, France was heavily relying on oil to meet the electricity needs of the population, but with the oil crisis coming in, the prime minister Pierre Messmer chose to develop the nuclear power of the country with this new project, allowing the country to compensate for the lack of indigenous energy resources.[3]The conflict started when a small group of people living in Erdeven went to see the conference about this new Messmer plan in Paris, to inform themselves about the future of the Nuclear in France and got out of the conference horrified by the possibility of a new power plant being built in their hometown.[4]That's why they decided to create a local committee to discuss these conflicts. As the committee gets bigger, demonstrations start to take place all over Brittany, the biggest one being the spring manifestation of 1975, with more than 15 000 people gathered in Erdeven to protest the construction of the nuclear power plant. This event brought together the people of Erdeven, ecological associations and anyone who wanted to abandon this project.The demonstration in Erdeven can be linked to several anti-nuclear demonstrations, which took place in the 1970s, following the announcement of an energy recovery plan. [10] One of the most important is that of Creys-Malville gathering more than 60,000 people and one of the protesters died [12][16]. In 2012, in Sweden, more than 7,500 people blocked the nuclear power plant to stop nuclear production. Hundreds of demonstrations are organized globally every year with the hope that nuclear projects will stop.The Messmer plan was going to impact drastically the environment, both, the people living around the nuclear power plant, but also on a more global point of view. For researchers in particular, the massive development of a nuclear program was a rushed decision, since the problem of waste was treated lightly [19]. That is why they asked the population to reject the project until they are clearly aware of the risks and consequences. On one hand, it is understandable for people living nearby the project to be worried ""Farmers assure you that plutonium will walk around"" [5]. Living around a power plant can be stressful knowing that if something bad happens, you will be among the most impacted out of everyone in the country. It also changes the landscape of the surroundings. In fact, building a power plant is not an easy task and you need to create big infrastructures to ensure the safety of everyone.On another hand, proponents of nuclear power plants frequently argue that these cannot be built everywhere, as very specific conditions are needed for potential sites such as no danger of floods or earthquakes, sufficient distance from densely populated areas, no interferences with other important installations and no danger ofcontaminating important water-supply areas [6]. By applying this type of criteria, the French government and EDF had identified Erdeven as a site for a nuclear power plant, while the region wanted to focus on the development of tourism and agriculture. ""The council, according to the mayor, prefers to focus on the development of tourism, crafts, and agriculture, and take into account the opposition expressed by the majority of the population."" [7] The Comité Régional d'Information Nucléaire (CRIN) is one of the main actors of this conflict. It was created as a response to the Messmer plan to defend the population from critical nuclear decisions and have enough power to be heard by the local authorities. EDF is also one of the main actors, overseeing the nuclear power plant project.Then there was also M. Alexandre Kerzerho, the mayor of Everden at the time, was really involved in the conflict. His first thought was only positive concerning the new nuclear power plant: new job opportunities, new income... but the doubt quickly came up when he started discussing with the population. [] On December 21, 1974, the city council voted against the construction of the power station. The mayor justified this position by fear of the dangers of nuclear power, despite the jobs created and the potential economic benefits for the municipality []. Thanks to the mobilisation of the local population the nuclear power plant was not built and nowadays we can see a ""green hand"" sculpture near Erdeven in honor of this victory.Evironmental Impacts of the nuclear industry We have known for a long time that nuclear energy has a strong environmental impact. Every year more than 200 tonnes of waste are discharged in France, into the oceans, rivers, and air [13]. Radioactive waste is the most dangerous to the environment because we do not know how to  safely manage radioactive wastes. So, it will remain dangerous for more than 100,000 years. In addition, a major accident of these plants such as in Chernobyl or Fukushima is unacceptable. Nuclear waste also has a significant impact on the health of the inhabitants, it can cause cancers, including lung, colon, and leukemia (blood cancer). It also poses a risk to the descendants of exposed persons: unborn children have more growth problems, malformations, and even mental disorders.",erdeven-nuclear-power-plant,NÃO,SIM,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA

"The Government of India introduced the concept of chemical hubs, calling them Mega-Chemical Industrial Estates (MCIES) in 2005, but a year later enlarged it and introduced the concept of Petroleum, Chemicals ad Petrochemicals Investment region (PCPIRs). Nandigram was scheduled to be one of these. The site is located in East Medinipur district of West Bengal, India. The place is about 160km away from Kolkata. Nandigram was designated as Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region and a special economic zone (SEZ). The notification for land acquisition was published in 2005, but the actual conflict began in January 2007 when the acquisition program started [1]. The local people, particularly the farmers, had been protesting against the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government to acquire agricultural land for setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). West Bengal police fired on protestors on March 14, 2007 killing 14 people at Nandigram [2]. A mob of nearly 5,000 villagers in Nandigram bloc in East Midnapore district fought against the police and security personnel [6]. This incidence played an important role in the politics of West Bengal for next few years. Mamata Banerjee the leader of opposition of the then west Bengal assembly widely used this issue along with the political slogan 'Ma Mati Manush' (Mother, Land, People) in their election campaigns. Trinmool Congress Party (TMC) took the full advantage of the acquisition scare among the local villagers. With her 'Ma-Mati-Manush' slogan, she hijacked the issues from the Left parties and win the assembly election in 2011 [3, 4]. The state cabinet later endorsed a plan to locate the Indonesia-based Salim group's chemical complex on the strip of land, called Nayachar (new sandbank) along the Haldi river by the West Bengal government. The chemical hub would be set up as a joint venture project of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Ltd and New Kolkata International Development. Indian Oil Corporation would be the anchor investor there. The NKID comprises three companies including the Salim Group of Indonesia.

"Joinkrama 4, popularly called JK4, is an Engene-speaking Ijaw community settled along the Taylor Creek and administratively situated in Ahoada West Local Government Area of River State, sharing boundaries with Biseni and Ikarama communities from the Yenagoa local government area in Bayelsa State. JK4 is in the Edagberi/Betterland Community area where there are over 40 oil wells drilled and operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company (hereafter SPDC). Additionally, several crude oil pipelines and Shell's Adibawa Flow Station are located within the community's territory. Field monitors from Environmental Rights Action  (hereafter ERA), namely Friends of the Earth Nigeria, visited the community by May 2002 and reported that the Adibawa lake was heavily polluted. They observed that oil slick was floating on its surface. This situation heavily impacts on fishermen daily life and the community folks as a whole.   ""Shell has not been fair to the community in terms of amenities say the leaders of the JK4 community, even though so much wealth is pumped out from our community soil daily. The population has been drinking from the Taylor Creek that has often been polluted by crude oil spills from the company's failed oil facilities"" [1]. ""Without pipe borne water the people have been drinking from the Taylor Creek that has often been polluted by crude oil spills"" [2]. Lots of oil spills are occurring, caused by old, rusty pipes in the community environment, and equipment failure. These material and equipment defects are confirmed by Shell itself. The company did some section replacements of the 12-inch Adibawa/Okordia delivery line in the first quarter of 2010. On September 18th in 2010, community people reported an oil spill caused by a sabotage, for which a Shell staff member and unknown community youth are responsible. The area is yet to undergo adequate compensation by the oil company, as affected community people have lost their means of livelihoods. On October 10th, 2011, ERA heard of a protest by women in the community, triggered by the pollution of the water potable sources, and ERA promptly visited the community [2]. Again by 2013, a member of the Caretaker Committee of JK4 community Mr.Ambrose Kofi Osuolo led ERA's field monitors to the spill sites and made related statements in response to questions: ""I am the Assistant Secretary of the Caretaker Committee of JK4 (Edagberi/Betterland) community. We noticed the spills on the 30th of April 2013 and Shell came for Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) on the 3rd of May, 2013. I represented my community on the JIV but the JIV was inconclusive due to different views held about the cause of spill. While Shell attributed the cause to sabotage, that the pipeline was drilled in; I was not convinced and hence, we didn't sign the JIV report. Although Shell came purposely for this particular spill, we discovered two more spill points within this Well 2 environment on that same day. The affected pipeline conveys crude oil from Well 2 to the nearby Adibawa Flow station. We reported to the Bayelsa State Ministry of Environment so that the Ministry can put pressure on Shell to come and mop up the spilt crude oil in the environment. We were so concerned because the crude oil is spreading in the swamps; especially with the rains. The Ministry was of the view that whatever differences there are about the cause of spill; the spill should be prevented from spreading; hence a claims agent was given the mandate to try and contain the spread. The Shell official who led the Shell team on the 3rd of May, 2013 was Tunde Joel, a Community Liaison Officer (CLO). One man we simply know as Ikainam, a Shell's Production leader was here to with them. This is the second spill point and, it is clear that the pipeline was tampered with by a third party. Shaw was used to cut it. There was no dispute about this. What we want Shell to do is to come and clean up the site"". At the third spill point Ambrose said: ""This rupture occurred at a joint; where two lengths of pipe were welded together. And up till now you can see that the spill point is bubbling; yet to be clamped by SPDC.""Yet slow responses by Shell to its pipelines' spills are recurrent, being constantly denounced by ERA. The NGO regrets that more than six months after a spill at Adibawa oil field from well 8 in July 2015, the clean-up of oil had  still to be completed [3]. ERA reports that on January 20th2016, exactly seven months after the spill, the impacted site went up in flames [4]. Shell informed ERA that it was going to go work on the recovery of the site. The NGO's field monitors are disappointing: ""The visit to the site didn't prove anything beyond the usual crude method of physically clearing burnt trees and other plants by felling them and heaping within the same environment and, going further to turn top soil upside down"" [4]. The community members complained that Shell burned their bush/forest instead of operating a proper clean-up of the spill.",joinkrama-oil-spill-jk-4-nigeria,SIM,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO,NÃO
"There were 50 coal-fired power plant construction plans in Japan identified after 2012.  At the same time, the local grassroots organizations are opposing these plans because of their concern for climate justice and local pollution problems. The network of environmental NGOs pressured the companies and governments for strict regulations on coal-fired power plants. As a result, amongst the 50 planned power plants, 12 were cancelled, or fuel was changed from coal to renewable, while 12 were in operation. Natural gas is also used in some cases instead of coal.  One of the cancelled projects was Soma Kyodo Power Plant in the Soma Core Industrial Park (in Japanese) ""Somachukoku kougyo danchinai hatsudensho"". At the northern end of the Pacific Ocean side of Fukushima Prefecture, near the prefectural border with Miyagi Prefecture, the Soma Core Industrial Park (total area 632 ha) was developed by Fukushima Prefecture, Soma City, and Shinchi Town. SomaKyodo Development LLC planned to build a small scale coal-fired power plant (112 MW) in 2014 that (as in other cases in Japan, a CFPP with a capacity of 112 MW  does not needs  to comply with the rules of larger ones). This is why there are several 112 MW CFPP under discussion. The public meeting was held in Soma City Community hall on June 12, 2014. In the following months, Fukushima Prefecture Environmental Impact Assessment Committee reviewed and commented on the project proposal. Then, from February 18, 2015, to March 17, the inspection process was carried out. Later in 2015, more assessment processes were carried out. However, later in the year, the operating company could not develop concrete plans to carry out the construction.  according to the  Kiko network, in 2017, coal was abandoned, Soma Kyodo Development LLC was dissolved, and Nippon Energy Partners Co., Ltd. took over the consideration of the biomass power generation business.

"In 1953, the Cimenterie Nationale corporation was founded, starting as a cement production plant with one Kiln. Over the decades, more kilns were added as well as reconditioning of the cement production process, improving quantity and efficiency in this production [8]. Despite seeking to be sustainable and environmentally friendly, as well as being awarded with ISO Certificates (ISO 14001) for it [6], Cimenterie Nationale is still seen as a potential source of air pollution to many of the locals in Chekka. The presence of this facility along with other industrial and recreational activities have heavily affected the region, making Chekka the ""most polluted city in the caza of Batroun"" [7]. Many residents in the coastal areas complain about heavy emissions, and report cases of asthma or other respiratory problems, and a number of them leave Chekka [7] [12] [13] [14]. Many officials, including factory owners, put the blame on the Ministries of Environment and Health, since they claim that these ministries are adequately intervening to improve the living quality in Chekka [7]. It is difficult to prove causation, as with other environmental pollutants. The best studies have been conducted by the American University of Beirut, University of Balamand, and the Lebanese American University. As many scientists know, cement factories release emissions of Sulfur Dioxide, Carbon Dioxide and Monoxide, some Nitrous Oxides, and above all, Particulate Matter [1] [4]. Being surrounded by coastal and mountainous villages [1], Chekka is already placed as a potential victim of concentrated air pollution geographically trapped within the area, especially when there is low wind. A journal article written by Rana Kobrossi and her colleagues looks into the Respiratory Health effects on young residents in different cities of Northern Lebanon, including Chekka, and in this study, they found associations between distance from factories and risk of coughs and phlegm (the closer they are to a cement factory, the higher the risk) [1]. Though the study focused more on children, along with the many factors that can affect the results, the results show that there was a higher prevalence of coughing, wheezing, and even bronchitis for those living close to the factories. Even those living a bit farther (in the region) reported cases of chronic coughing [1].",chekaa,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"On July 16th 2019 Green Action (Zelena Akcija) activists  protested in Zagreb's main square. During the protests, the activist have show a map of Croatia from which it could be seen that the Croatian Government is preparing a massive concessions for oil and gas exploration of the country. Namely,  75% of the continental state-owned land is under the consensus! [1] [3]Twenty-five new exploration wells are planned as part of the new cycle of onshore exploration for which Croatia has awarded licenses. Adding to this the exploration already underway in Eastern Slavonia, there are plans to drill approximately 30 new wells in the Pannonian Basin [7]. Besides the map showed at the protest, the activists also set up a performance that included an improvised installation of 30 new wells around the square symbolising only some of the locations for which, according to the Government's plan, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas will start soon [1] [3]. The mayor concern the activists expressed and protested against is the fact of the ""land grab"" hidden behind this mega economic project plan: 3/4 of the whole state-owned land is offered to multinational oil and gas companies. On the other hand, the Croatian government argues, that the project is needed in order to increase economic growth by 2040 [1] [3]. These exploration fields are massive and spanning everywher from Vukovar-Srijem through Zagreb and Lika-Senj to Split-Dalmatia County. All Zagorje is under concessions too, Međimurje and Banija and the Karst and Karlovac and Gorski Kotar and Lika areas as well. Within these areas there are many sites rich in water, biodiversity, and traditional agriculture [1].The license for exploration and production in the Sava-07 exploration block was awarded to the Canadian company Vermilion Zagreb Exploration d.o.o., which is already performing exploration works in the area of Eastern Slavonia. INA - Industrija nafte d.d. was awarded exploration licenses for two exploration blocks, Drava-03 and North-western Croatia-01 [7].Also the US oil company Aspect Holdings, LLC, whose subsidiary Aspect Croatia was awarded an exploration license for the Sava-06 exploration block, and the Croatian oil company Crodux derivati dva d.o.o., which will perform exploration works in Sava-11 and Sava-12 exploration blocks [7].The activists also argued that the Government is hiding this process and the decision from the public. For instance, contracts, conditions and technologies for exploration and exploitation are kept confidential [1]. So far, the concessions were given to Canadian Vermilion Oil and the Croatian Oil Industry --Industrija nafte d.o.o (INA)  [1] [3].Drillings would have an extremely negative effect on the local population, drinking water, biodiversity, and would cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as well.

"Freeport became interested in West Papua in the 1950s, and in 1965, negotiations between Freeport and Indonesia began one month after a military coup and widespread massacres brought General Suharto to power. Freeport was the first foreign corporation to sign a deal with Suharto's regime. The 1967 agreement gave the company broad powers over the local population and resources, including the right to take, on a tax-free basis, land, timber, water, and other natural resources, and to resettle indigenous inhabitants while providing reasonable compensation only for dwellings find permanent improvements. Under the new Indonesian regime, the indigenous population had no rights of refusal or of informed consent, nor any right to adequate compensation. A sign of the times, no social or environmental impact assessment was done. The two main communities impacted, the Amungme and Kamoro, numbered several thousand people, organized in clan-based village social and governance structures. With lands encompassing the areas tropical rainforest, coastal lowlands, and glacial mountains and river valleys, the Kamoro (lowlanders) and Amungme (highlanders) practiced a subsistence economy based on sustainable agriculture and forest products, fishing, and hunting; their cultures intimately entwined with the surrounding landscape. [1] Resistance to Freeport and other colonizers began immediately. This has taken the form of armed attacks against the mine and its workers. In 1977, the OPM blew up an important pipeline, shutting the mine down for several days. The ecology of West Papua is one of the most biodiverse places on Earth, with up to 7% of all plant and animal species being found there. Freeport's mining operation in West Papua has destroyed this environment, which the Amungme and Kamoro hold sacred and subsist on. The mine has taken 120 meters off of the top of a sacred Amungme mountain. Freeport dumps millions of tons of silt-like tailings into the local river system, polluting it with metals and turning a miles-wide lowland river area into a dead, barren landscape. The river is now almost entirely devoid of any life. They pile toxic waste rock thousands of feet high at dumpsites in the surrounding area including at a sacred lake used by the Amungme. Filling valleys with mine waste that leaches copper, acid, and mercury into the ground, they have polluted springheads tribal people miles away use for drinking water. The rainwater run off from these toxic landfills has resulted in even more pollution. Local people have died when Freeport poisoned the water people drink, and the piles of waste have resulted in landslides. While landscape reclamation projects have begun at the mine, environmental groups and local inhabitants are concerned with the potential for copper contamination and acid mine drainage from the mine tailings into surrounding river systems, land surfaces, and groundwater. In 1977 the rebel group Free Papua Movement attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, allegedly killing at least 800 people. By the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at Grasberg (Dutch, Grass Mountain), just 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from the Ertsberg mine. The Grasberg Mine is the largest gold mine and the third largest copper mine in the world. In 1996, Tom Beanal, a leader of the Amungme people of West Papua, filed suit against Freeport-McMoRan in US federal court. Beanal alleged that Freeport was complicit in human rights abuses committed against him and the Amungme people by security forces employed by Freeport; the human rights violations alleged were surveillance, mental torture, death threats and house arrest. Beanal also alleged that Freeport's operations in West Papua caused severe degradation to the Amungme's environment and habitat. Finally, Beanal alleged that Freeport's mining operations resulted in 'cultural genocide' by destroying the Amungme's habitat and religious symbols. The same year, Yosefa Alomang also filed suit against Freeport-McMoRan in Louisiana state court. A mother of six, Alomang became a leader in the fight against Freeport in reaction to military action against the local population when hundreds of Amungme people cut a Freeport pipeline. The protest had itself resulted from the killing of thirty people after a peaceful protest. Bombs and bullets then totally wiped out Waa and Kwakmi villages - and villagers fled to hide in the forests. She protested, filed lawsuits, worked to free imprisoned activists, and more for years . Alomang also set up a women's cooperative called Kulalok that destroyed produce that Freeport important so that Freeport would be forced to pay attention to them and buy local goods. She also founded Yahamak, the Foundation Against Violence and for Human Rights. The work she did with them earned her the Goldman Prize as well as a $248,000 reward from Freeport in 2001 for a clinic, meeting hall, orphanage, and human rights violations monument. However, Alomang continued protesting against Freeport because a major pit collapse at the Freeport's giant Grasberg mine killed 9 workers in 2003 [3].WALHI (Friends of the Earth Indonesia) won a landmark case against Freeport in 2001. The case, filed in the South Jakarta District Court, found the company guilty of violating Indonesian environmental law for their role in the May 2000 landslide at the Wanagon Dam. WALHI accused Freeport of deliberately concealing information about the landslide and giving false and inaccurate explanations to the public. Freeport's press releases blamed the slide solely on heavy rainfall, but Indonesia's environmental protection agency, Bapedal, found that Freeport had been dumping twice the permitted amount of waste at the dam prior to the slide. The court ordered Freeport to minimize the risk of more rock slides at Wanagon and to reduce the creation of toxic waste to comply with water quality standards [4].In February and March 2006, residents shut the mine down for several days while students demonstrated in the provincial capital of Jayapura and in Jakarta. Police injured and killed several of the protesters [4]. But justice was not served on the Amungme. By 2014, Freeport's target was to sell 2,118,525 tonnes of copper concentrate from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia this year. The concern was to build a smelter, to refine copper because of Indonesia's ban on concentrate exports, and also a higher export tax. In 2021, Arizona-based Freeport-McMoran has nearly doubled copper and gold production at its landmark Grasberg mine following a ramp-up from depressed COVID operations [5]. Papuans continue to face violence and intimidation from.  Inhabitants of the villages that surround the mine are prevented from taking trips to the forest to hunt or to their vegetable gardens, which are frequently far from their homes.  The military accuses anyone leaving of being terrorists. Many of the residents face starvation and malnutrition without their staple gardens and hunted meat. This situation is part of a larger system of oppression by the Indonesian government of the West Papuan people since the ""Act of Free Choice."" Citizens who express cultural identity such as singing songs in the local language or advocating for the preservation of traditional lands are labeled ""separatists"" and are subject to imprisonment, torture and even murder [4].Since then, the conflict has also increased gender-based violence, most commonly though not exclusively targeting women and girls. Environmental factors have disproportionate factors on the indigenous women battling against the extractive industry in a conflict-prone territory.

"For decades, residents of Camden, New Jersey, have struggled against environmental racism with little acknowledgment or success. The Waterfront South community has become an environmental sacrifice zone, with residents having trouble enforcing their fundamental civil rights, health, and safety. After decades of white flight to the neighboring suburban communities, Camden has an almost exclusively African American and Latino population while also being the poorest city in New Jersey and one of the poorest in the nation [1]. The per capita income is less than $10,000, the citywide poverty rate is over 30 percent, and the murder rate and school dropout rates are the highest in the state [1]. Waterfront South, measuring less than one square mile, is the most affected by environmental degradation. The community extends east to west from an interstate highway on the Delaware River, encompassing most of the South Jersey port, the former base for a major ship-building company. Within this small community, stand one federal Superfund sites and another previous Superfund site [1]. The first site, the General Gas Mantle Corporation site, contains radioactive thorium. The thorium is a ""by-product of a gas-lantern mantle manufacturing business that operated in the neighborhood from 1915 to 1940"" [1]. While the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection first discovered the radioactivity in 1981, no action was taken until 1992 when the warehouse was relocated, and then ten years later torn down [1]. The radioactive soil in nearby backyards and basements has still not been removed. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ""long-term exposure to low-level radiation has increased, by 1.8 percent, the cancer risk of residents whose homes were next to the Superfund site"" [1]. The second ""cleaned up"" Superfund site in Waterfront South, Martin Aaron, Incorporated, was created by ""various steel drum reconditioning companies operated at the site for approximately 30 years, ending in 1998"" [2]. The steel drum reconditioning operations involved draining drums into tanks and pressure-washing, steam-rinsing and drying, sand-blasting, and repainting the drums. Residues from drum contents, rinsate, and steam blow-down drained from tanks and floor drain into skimming basins. Sludge was skimmed from the basins for off-site disposal and acidic water was neutralized and reused in the plant. Industrial activity at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds, and other chemicals [1]. The EPA's National Priorities List reports: ""contaminated soils at depths below the water table"" [1]. The Responsible Party began the cleanup in 2016 and completed the excavation and disposal of contaminated soils in November 2018 [2]. There are thirteen other known contaminated sites in Waterfront South. These include: ""four junkyards, a petroleum coke transfer station, a scrap metal recycler, several auto body shops, a paint and varnish company, a chemical manufacturing company, three food-processing plants, and numerous other heavy industrial businesses"" [1]. All of these businesses rely on diesel trucks to transport materials. Among these many polluted sites, Camden's largest environmental justice struggle is with the St. Lawrence Cement Company (SLC), one of the world's largest manufacturers of cement [1]. In March 1999, ""the company negotiated a lease with the South Jersey Port Corporation, a state agency, for twelve acres of land along the Delaware River at the port's Broadway terminal in Waterfront South to construct a cement-grinding facility"" [1]. The cement company operations generate an estimated 77,000 diesel truck trips and emit one hundred tons of pollutants each year. According to a study by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), ""taking the several independent lines of evidence together, the findings of this study suggest that the St. Lawrence/Holcim facility accounts for about 2-13% of the total dust material at a distance of up to about 0.5 km from the exposed piles of material"" [3]. Because port land is exempt from zoning and planning, the company did not have to obtain any local board approvals or involve city officials [1]. Permits indicate that the proposed facility's emissions of lead, manganese, and radioactive materials would comply with applicable state and federal requirements [1]. Because NJDEP only has jurisdiction over permitting stationary source pollutants, the company was not required to obtain permits from NJDEP for emissions generated by the truck traffic to and from the facility [4]. This experienced major pushback from the grassroots organization, South Camden Citizens in Action (SCCIA). The SCCIA was formed in 1997 after a local nonprofit organization in Waterfront South decided to sponsor a grassroots neighborhood planning project and brought together residents to explore how living conditions could be improved [1]. These community leaders were not experienced activists, they were mostly African American women of low income and some of poor health. In South Camden Citizens in Action v. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the minority community used EPA Title VI regulations to block NJDEP's issuance of air permits to a pollutant-producing facility. The South Camden plaintiffs had, for the first time in federal court, won recognition that civil rights law prohibiting adverse disparate impact requires more than compliance with environmental statutes [4]. SCCIA successfully demonstrated that ""the permitting and operation of the SLC facility, when considered in the context of the current health conditions and existing environmental burdens in the Waterfront South community, was likely to adversely affect their health to a degree that meets the standard of 'adversity' under Title VI"" [4]. Despite this success, under Section 1983, the Third Circuit held that EPA's disparate impact regulations did not create rights enforceable by private parties [4]. St. Lawrence Cement Company, now owned by Lehigh Cement under parent company HeidelbergCement, continues, in violation of EPA's Title VI regulations and to the detriment of the health of the residents of the surrounding community, to process granulated blast furnace slag at its Waterfront South facility. Lehigh Cement's website claims to ""build a better future"" and ""to create sustainable value by industry-leading products and solutions to satisfy the construction needs of our customers around the world"" [7]. With a capacity of 600,000 tons annually, Lehigh Hanson's highly Camden plant at Broadway Marine Terminal is 90% automated and employs 14 full-time employees, not including the stevedores, truck drivers and other supporting workers [8]. This means it is not supplying many jobs to the impoverished Waterfront South Community. It imports steel slag from Japan and, by barge and truck, supplies its slag cement product for the construction industry throughout the mid-Atlantic, from Virginia to upstate New York [8]. The Waterfront South Community continues to be disproportionately impacted by polluting facilities. For years, Waterfront South residents have been forced to endure toxic fumes, dust, horrific odors, and noise. Truck drivers frequently violate traffic codes by taking shortcuts down residential streets and endangering young children playing outside. The incinerator, power plant, licorice plant, and gypsum plant emit tons of inhalable particulates known to cause lung cancer and aggravate respiratory issues such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis as well as triggering cardiovascular symptoms, bringing premature death [1]. The Waterfront South area has the highest readings in the state for inhalable particulate pollution, and the ozone levels significantly exceed federal air quality standards. An odor study as part of the Air Toxics Pilot Project found that ""61 percent of residents experienced some type of respiratory symptoms, compared to 35 percent in a different Camden neighborhood"" [1]. Due to the sewage treatment plant, residents are living with noxious odors, and have a dulled sense of smell. The housing values in Waterfront South have dropped dramatically making it increasingly difficult for the remaining households to move out. The community now has close to two thousand residents, with almost half of them being children [1]. Despite legal setbacks, the South Camden Citizens in Action v. NJDEP litigation has significantly furthered environmental justice advocacy on the local, state, and national levels. The two-month delay in the start of the cement company's operations cost the company millions of dollars [1]. The high profile case has generated a lot of attention, receiving coverage in major news media such as the New York Times, BusinessWeek, National Public Radio, the National Law Journal, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. The SCCIA is working together with other area activists, organizing numerous neighborhood educational events, protests, and petition campaigns [1]. They have banded together with nearby supporters to form the Camden Environmental Justice Coalition gaining support from local officials. Olivia Glenn, who grew up in the Parkside section of Camden, remembers being plagued by respiratory issues until she left the city for Dartmouth, stating, ""When I went away to college, I could breathe"" [5]. The disparate environmental impacts Glenn was faced with inspired her to become an environmentalist and major in Environmental Studies. Returning to Camden as chief of staff and senior advisor for equity for Region 2 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Glenn shared her personal story of issues with Camden's air quality with a panel of students who addressed environmental justice and advocacy through art. The panel has created ""Town Hall: Resolution 50"" to tell the story of students mobilizing and protesting environmental problems in their Camden neighborhood. One student argued that ""environmental racism in Camden is huge,"" and also noted that black clouds do not rise from factories in Cherry Hill or Haddonfield, two wealthier New Jersey cities [5]. A local non-profit, the Superior Arts Institute, focused on the arts, hopes to raise awareness around environmental racism in the city through a community-oriented project with the help of the Trust for Public Land [6]. The two-part series is currently live on Youtube under the Superior Arts Institute page [9].",camden-new-jersey-usa,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The Strait of Messina Bridge is a project intended to create a 3.300 m bridge across the Strait of Messina, to link Sicily with Calabria, the southern tip of mainland Italy. The bridge would be the largest suspension bridge in the world, with both road and rail sections and would be part of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) line connecting Central and Southern Europe. The bridge project has been met by increasing opposition by the ""No Ponte"" movement, initially constituted by local citizens and now expanded and networked with other national movement against big infrastructures. The idea to link Sicily with the continent through the strait dates back to Roman times, but a real planning stage started in the 1960s. In 1969 the Italian ministry of Transport arranged an international design competition for planning the crossing of the Strait. In 1971 a law was issued for the creation of a private company, concessionaire for the design, implementation and management of a road and rail connection. In 1981, the company Stretto di Messina S.p.A. was set up. In 1992, the preliminary project for a bridge crossing the strait was presented. In the 80s, the first protests emerged against the imposition of the mega project in an area severely damaged by unregulated overbuilding and with other priorities to improve urban development. In the 90s, local citizens focused on disseminating information and garnered the support of the green and communist parties. Starting from 2001, real mobilization began (demonstrations, camping, civil disobedience and legal actions). In July 2002, the first camp in opposition to the project was organized on the Strait shores, and others followed. The movement became increasingly popular and the support from environmental associations and national committees increased. The No Ponte movement criticizes the project for its environmental impacts on a unique landscape protected by the European Union located within two Special Protection Areas and affecting in both regions 11 Sites of Community Importance. Other criticism entails the financial sustainability of the infrastructure whose cost has risen over the years and would have to rely on tolls to support the project financing. Nevertheless, estimated traffic data demonstrate the improbability to cover the costs of the project based on tolls [1]. The movement expresses concern about the likely risk of mafia infiltration in the financing or in the procurement system, later confirmed by judiciary investigations[3]. Moreover, the protests have seriously put into question the technical feasibility of the infrastructure and its location in an area of high seismic risk. However, on October 2005 the role of General Contractor was assigned to the consortium Eurolink as a result of a tender. Completion was planned in six years at a projected cost of €3.9 billion. In the same year investigations of the District Anti Mafia discovered an attempt by local mafia to infiltrate in the works. In 2006, the largest demonstration No Ponte took place in Messina, with 20,000 participants. In the following years, the alternation of governments and decisions on the big infrastructure put at risk the construction, but in 2008 the new government led by the prime minister Berlusconi decided to restart the project to build the bridge. In 2009 preparatory work started. In reaction to it, in December 2009 a big demonstration with 10.000 participants was organized in the construction sites, with a huge amount of police forces employed for the control of the event. In 2010, Eurolink deliver the final design of the bridge to the Stretto di Messina S.p.A, the new estimated cost was €8.5 billion. Subsequently, environmental groups drafted official letters of their observations on the unsustainability of the project as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure[2]. In 2011, the European Union excluded the bridge from public works designed to receive EU funding for 2014-2020. In 2012, the Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) removed funding for the project. The new technocratic government decided to stop the project for lack of funds and extend for two years the terms for approval of the final project to prove technical and financial feasibility. In 2013, the Stretto di Messina S.p.A. was put into liquidation. The consortium Eurolink asked a monetary compensation to the Italian State for the cancelling of the project. The latter in its preliminary stage and promotion has already cost €500 million and constructors are requesting €700 million. In 2013 a demonstration was organized by the No Ponte movement in objection to the payment of the penalty.",the-bridge-over-the-strait-of-messina,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"""This once glorious and picturesque freshwater body is now doomed to become a dead lake."" [1]  Kolleru is one of Asia's largest freshwater lakes. It is located in Andhra Pradesh, and is a famous habitat for a number of resident and migratory birds, including the vulnerable grey pelican. Situated between the Godavari and Krishna river basins, it is an invaluable wetland ecosystem. The lake spans 90,100ha and the water shrinks or expands depending on the rains' many rivulets drain into the Kolleru and surplus waters run off into the Bay of Bengal. There are about 75 abutting villages who long co-existed harmoniously with the birds and resources of the lake. The government assigned lands in the lake area to Scheduled and Backward Castes, who used their areas for fish tanks and agriculture. During the 1970s the fishermen were encouraged to form co-operatives and loans were sanctioned for seasonal cultivation. Because of repeated floods, the banks and government encouraged them to convert agricultural land to fish ponds and tanks. In the early 1990s aquaculture boomed. The problem was that it needed saline water to flourish and borewells were sunk in the lake bed to pump out saline water for the aqua ponds. Consequently the lake bed and banks sank and the tides brought in more saline water. The aquaculture practice requires chemical fertilizers, manure and chicken waste. Once the harvest is over, the water stagnates and pollutes surrounding water. As a result, the drinking water of dozens of island villages has been polluted and the lake has undergone chemical and biological changes that have contributed to its depletion and pollution. The water has turned saline, fish are contaminated with pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals have entered the lake, making fish and prawns unfit for human consumption. The degradation of the Kolleru has many implications for the weaker sections of the community. The poor blame the rich aqua farmers who were responsible for the shift from traditional freshwater fishing to saline prawn farming. It is ironic that the main problem is the dearth of drinking water in the neighbourhood of the largest freshwater lake in the country. [1] Four tonnes of fish died at the Atapaka bird sanctuary in 2015. Residents alleged Forest Department authorities were negligent in their management of the lake, while the Krishna district Deputy Director of Fisheries said fish deaths were due to decreased water levels and low dissolved oxygen levels. ""Though the locals have been alerting the forest staff over the decreasing water levels from December, no measures have been taken for maintaining the water levels to ensure survival of the fish which are prey for migratory birds. In 2012, the lake huge quantities of fish were killed for similar reasons. But the officials, in a planned manner, have not taken preventive measures,"" resident said Sita Mahalakshmi. [6]  Public conflict has been somewhat limited, with most coming in the forms of legal challenges. The lake has unlawfully been converted into a commercial fishing hub, but according to a Times of India report, there is limited local opposition. ""It's not the locals but politicians and rich businessmen are involved in this activity. But fearing these political mafias, nobody is raising their voice to protest. Any government officer who would protest these illegal activities would be threatened, harassed and transferred by politicians,"" the newspaper reported a forest official from another district said on condition of anonymity. [3] There is conflict between conservationists and the local community over reducing the size of the lake - wildlife groups oppose the reduction, while residents support the government proposal.

"Since approximately 2005-2007, motivated by the increase in the price of gold in the market, illegal mining companies, lacking any concession or title, began to settle in the northern province of Esmeraldas. The mining operation was concentrated around the rivers of the Santiago-Cayapas basin, directly affecting 24 communities, the cities of Borbón and San Lorenzo, and the Río Santiago Cayapas Community, one of the oldest communal territories in Ecuador. In 2010, the residents of the area reported the presence of more than 200 illegal operations conducted by people from outside the area. Their operation caused a significant deterioration of security in the area as armed groups intimidated the population and silenced any signs of dissatisfaction. Illegal mining is one of the most serious environmental disasters that has affected the north of Esmeraldas, destroying vegetation and opening new roads that accelerate deforestation. The water pollution by metals and arsenic is of such magnitude that a study by an official entity recognized that it is not suitable for human consumption. The lives of the aquatic communities are also in danger. Socially, the impacts of illegal mining translate into organizational fragmentation, increased conflict, and violence. Faced with social and environmental deterioration, the population demanded government intervention. Since 2009, the government tried to stop illegal mining by combining the action of the public force with the declaration of states of emergency. In the face of the failure of these measures, in June 2011, the government launched the ""Artisanal Community Metallurgical Mining Plan"", a response that has meant the regularization of illegal miners and the granting of approximately 40 thousand hectares in concession for the National Mining Company (ENAMI) to partner with small-scale and artisanal miners in gold extraction. The initiative promoted by the government to launch a mixed enterprise did not succeed, as in 2015, ENAMI determined that the project was economically unfeasible: monthly revenues of 17,008.84 dollars versus monthly operating costs amounting to 118,774.57 dollars (Lucero, 2014: 161). The exit of the state mining company has not limited the presence of mining. On the contrary, legalized miners and others who continue to operate outside the regulations have shaped a scenario of gradual consolidation of open-pit mining in the north of Esmeraldas, without consulting the population. In the transition from an absent state to one that practices extractive activities, not only has the development of illegal mining activities continued, but gradually the entire social dynamic is being organized around mining, affecting agriculture, livestock, and emerging tourism initiatives. By strengthening mining, the potential effects that could increase in scale and spread to neighboring areas were not considered. Currently, an increase in timber extraction and pollution risks towards the southern area of the Cayapas-Mataje Reserve, whose mangroves provide income for 5000 artisanal fishermen and people involved in shellfish extraction, is already being observed.",mining-in-esmeraldas,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) started exploration activities in the area of Molleturo in 1994 and one year later it discovered a gold mineralization on the Canoas concession. That year also emerged social unrest among communities belonging to the parishes of Molleturo and Chaucha. Among the main reasons were unaccomplished economic promises made by the company as well as land tenure conflicts and environmental concerns. The company began to t work in the Molleturo Protective Forest, an area that embraces 25 watersheds and important source of water for agriculture and human consumption. As a result of RTZs presence in the area local conflicts among communities disrupted the peaceful life together. In light of this situation, communities opposing mining activities demanded the RTZs withdrawal from their locality. Authorities did not respond to their claims and RTZ continued with its prospective activities in the area. In 1997 the company left the country after stating that these mineral deposits were not profitable in economic terms. However, in 1996 the mining firm IMC signed a joint venture agreement with RTZ and in 1999 this same firm re-initiated RTZs previous exploring activities in the area",rio-tinto-zinc-in-molleturo-ecuador,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) oil refinery was found to be out of compliance with the Clean Air Act on several occasions and released contaminants such as benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and toluene into the environment. Residents of Grays Ferry, a predominantly black neighborhood across the highway from PES, called the refinery a ""silent killer"" [5]. Studies show heightened cases of asthma and cancer in the area. The New York Times reported that ""the death rate for the city's Black patients is 50 percent higher than for white patients"" [5]. Local community members and grassroots organizations like Philly Thrive spoke out at City Hall, made petitions, and protested PES. Though the refinery filed for bankruptcy and closed in 2019 following multiple factory explosions, cleanup of the contaminated area is still in the works [2].  The Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refinery was located on 1,400 acres of waterfront land near the Schuylkill River in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the largest and oldest refinery on the East Coast. Part of the refinery was built in Point Breeze in 1866 by the Atlantic Storage Company and used to store and transport petroleum [2]. The New York Times reports that ""By 1891, half the world's lighting fuel and more than a third of U.S. petroleum exports came from the refinery"" [5].  In the 1920s, the Gulf Oil Company built a separate refinery nearby. Sunoco purchased both refineries during the 1980s and combined them into the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery. The property was sold to Philadelphia Energy Solutions in 2012 [2].According to 2016 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, the bulk of toxic air emissions in Philadelphia came from PES. The refinery had been ""out of compliance with the Clean Air Act nine of the past 12 quarters through 2019 with little recourse"". PES was fined almost $650,000 for their violations between 2014-2019. Further, ""benzene emission data, which EPA began posting early last year, shows the refinery exceeded the benzene emissions limit for all but 12 weeks from the end of January 2018 to late September 2019 — an 86-week span [5]. Residents of Grays Ferry, a predominantly black community, reported feeling constant effects of high levels of air pollution coming from PES. These effects include difficulty breathing, increased coughs, and the ""South Philly postnasal drip"" [5]. There are increased rates of asthma and cancer throughout the community. In addition, long term exposure to air pollution increases susceptibility to air borne diseases like Covid-19, which killed 54 residents between January and July of 2020 [5].The area around PES was not always dominated by people of color. Like many cities on the East Coast, the Black population increased drastically during the Great Migrations beginning in the 1910s. Following the shift in demographics, in 1934, the area was redlined. South Philly was given a D rating by the Homeowner's Loan Corporation. Lending institutions issued fewer mortgages here than other parts of the city, leading to segregation and disinvestment in neighborhoods like Gray's Ferry [5].In reaction to the pattern of increasing illness throughout Grays Ferry, residents joined with Philly Thrive, a local grassroots organization, to concentrate efforts against PES. Philly Thrive, founded by young activist Alexa Ross, organizes campaigns and runs community support programs. Philly Thrive established the Right to Breathe campaign in 2015 alongside community members who had been affected by PES. For five years, they attended city hall meetings, organized disruptions, and held leadership meetings [3]. On June 21, 2019, there was a massive explosion at PES. The explosion caused large chunks of debris to fall from the sky onto the streets and black smog to cover Grays Ferry. City officials asserted that citizens were in no immediate danger, though the Philly Voice reported that ""the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board determined that the explosion and fire released about 5,000 pounds of hydrofluoric acid, a chemical that can cause skin damage, chronic lung disease, blindness, and other conditions"" [6]. Four days after the explosion, 100 Philly Thrive gathered near PES in protest [5]. The event was covered by many media sources. Following the explosion, PES filed for bankruptcy and had to sell the property. The land was sold for $225 million to Hilco Redevelopment Partners in January 2020. Hilco advertised that they would build a mixed-use industrial park [2]. ""This will be welcome environmental progress for neighborhoods that have suffered from the effects of the refinery,"" said Roberto Perez, the chief executive of Hilco Redevelopment Partners, ""and an exciting new chapter for Philadelphia"" [5].Philly Thrive publicized the end of their Right to Breathe campaign with the successful closure of PES. In 2021, the organization launched their Right to Thrive campaign focused on remediation of the refinery site. They claim that ""together we're organizing to win a complete cleanup of the site and robust reinvestment in our neighborhoods"" [3]. During a protest on June 22, 2020, Philly Thrive announced two demands for their new campaign. Protesters insisted that community members be a part of the redevelopment decisions moving forward and that the city council should cancel its plan to give Hilco tax breaks for their development through the Key Stone opportunity Zones. Philly Thrive released a statement claiming that ""tax breaks for corporations are unjust, especially while we are in an economic depression and the city cuts social services to save on its budget"" [4]. In the past, Hilco has faced criticism for a lack of transparency with the public and for excluding community members from decision-making [4]. Protesters were seen sporting signs that said, ""we can't afford closed door decisions"" [3]. Remediation of the contaminated property is currently underway. Hilco shares the responsibility of clean-up with Evergreen, an affiliate of Sunoco. Evergreen is responsible for cleanup of contamination that existed prior to 2012, referred to as ""legacy remediation"" [2]. Hilco oversees above-ground remediation including demolition, future development, and any chemicals released post 2013 while Evergreen must clean up all below-ground contamination such as surface water on and near property, soil under the site, and groundwater [2]. This is part of an agreement Sunoco made in 1993 with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) through the Act 2 program. At this point of the Act 2 program, Evergreen is required to conduct an environmental investigation of contamination and a risk assessment which summarizes environmental conditions and public health risks. Act 2 also demands that Evergreen notify the public of its findings and provide an opportunity for public comment. Comments are reviewed before the report is finalized. This process is detailed on Evergreen's website with an informational video and map. Evergreen claims that they are ""committed to engaging with the public to keep you informed and to get your input"" [2]. Following remediation, Hilco plans to turn the property into a hub for logistics, e-commerce and life sciences called The Bellwether District. Roberto Perez, CEO of Hilco Redevelopment Partners said ""The Bellwether District is a holistic, thoughtful reimagining of post-industrial property into a cleaner, greener and more sustainable workplace for generations of people and businesses"" [1]. The company promises to provide 19,000 jobs over the next 15 years [1]. On the surface, it seems like justice has been served. The refinery closed, the property is being remediated, and the community of Grays Ferry will be able to breathe freely once again. However, questions remain about the integrity of Hilco's goals and whether the new development will bring gentrification and further ostracize people of color and low-income folks in South Philly.",united-states-oil-refinery-philadelphia-energy-solutions-releases-high-levels-of-benzene-and-other-carcinogenic-pollutants-in-south-philadelphia,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Hundreds of waste pickers from Thailand's Saleng and Recycle Trader Association (SRTA) gathered in Bangkok during September 2021 to protest the continuous import of foreign waste outside government offices [1].After China banned foreign waste imports, including electronics and plastics waste, in 2017, Thailand became one of the world's largest garbage dumps [2]. As a consequence, the garbage from many developed countries that was formerly carried to China is now being transferred to Southeast Asian countries where environmental rules are not strictly enforced.According to Greenpeace's 2019 report, the total volume of imported plastic garbage in the AESAN region increased from 836,529 tonnes to 2,265,962 tonnes between 2016 and 2018 [3]. As a result, Thailand has found itself in the terrible situation of becoming a new disposal destination for foreign waste. Worse, according to Bangkok Post, the imported e-waste increased from almost 2,000 tons in 2016 to over 54,000 tons in 2017. These wastes arrived at Thai ports due to lack of law enforcement [2].The surplus supply of recyclable waste has dropped the recycling prices in Thailand dramatically. The livelihoods of the estimated 1.5 million marginalised individuals who collect, sort, and transport recyclables are in jeopardy [4]. This group of people is known as ""Saleng"", the Thai word for the three-wheeled carts they drive. ""Saleng"" are unsatisfied with the price plummet due to the weak recyclable waste import control. Thus they request that a government-appointed subcommittee on plastic waste, chaired by the Environment Minister, discontinue plans to extend the time limit for plastic waste imports by another five years. Instead, the government should accelerate the process of plastic import ban by the end of 2021 [1].Around 30,000 government-registered recycling companies buy materials from the Saleng and sell them in bulk to manufacturers [1]. They, too, have been impacted by the price drop, according to Thawat Krairak, owner of a medium-sized recycling company in Bangkok and one of the SRTA's founders. Thawat Krairak stressed, ""At the beginning of 2019, the price of waste paper dropped from around seven baht (US$0.21) to below two baht (US$0.06) per kilo."" ""This meant that people who specialised in buying and selling paper lost a lot of money. I myself personally lost over a million baht, and people were not able to continue dealing in paper"" [1].The government planned to ban plastic imports in September 2020 as part of its Roadmap for Plastic Waste Management 2018–2030 [5]. However, the ban has yet to take effect, and the authorities are currently considering extending the current policy until 2023 or 2025. The SRTA and others involved hope to get the ban in place by the end of 2021 [1].In desperation of seeing no ban in sight, the Saleng's protests in September were started by an online meeting involving government agencies and other parties involved in the garbage import and recycling sector, including large manufacturers, on the 6th of September 2021. At the meeting, Attaphon Charoenchansa, the director-general of the Pollution Control Department, explained that the authorities are considering three options for the plastic waste import ban: cancel all remaining imports that have already been agreed upon, commence the ban in 2023, or postpone it until 2025 [1].The online conference was attended by SRTA representatives as well as concerned environmental groups such as NGO Ecological Alert Recovery Thailand (EARTH) and Greenpeace. However, they claim that as soon as they presented themselves, there was hostility to their participation, and they were removed out of the online conference one by one [1]. The wastepickers Saleng viewed their expulsion from the conference as an indication that their voices were not being heard or respected [1].SRTA were resolved to make their dissatisfaction heard, holding signs proclaiming their demands and calling on officials to come out and receive their petitions at the Ministry of Industry in September 2021. They thought that by doing so, the government would be persuaded to implement the ban immediately [1].EARTH and other environmental organisations like Greenpeace began researching and advocating on the issue of transboundary waste entering Thailand for decades. The collaboration between environmental organisations and SRTA began from the surge in imports in 2018. Two sides decided to work together, targeting the issue from both an environmental and an economic standpoint.The Saleng have proven to be a significant ally in the drive for a ban due to their size. Around 1,000 collectors, many of whom were accompanied by carts, came on the Ministry of Commerce in late 2019 to urge that the government intervene in the falling price of recycled paper [6]. As a result, the government increased the minimum purchase price of waste paper from 0.5 baht (US$0.01) to over two baht (US$0.06) per kg in February 2020, satisfying the Saleng [7].An alliance of 108 civil society organisation is skeptical that a ban will be enacted this year, and they are considering legal action against the government if that does not happen [8][9]. However, several of the Saleng are considering taking a different approach: leveraging their extensive network to simply cease collecting rubbish and see what happens [1].The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the burden of waste imports on the Saleng's economic predicament. They have struggled to collect enough recyclables to make a living due to repeated lockdowns. According to the United Nations [10], the pandemic has pushed millions of Thailand's poorest people back into poverty, increasing their reliance on low-wage jobs like the Saleng's [11].",thai-waste-pickers-livelihoods-threatened-by-continued-waste-imports,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Located in the northeast of Fujian Province, Pingnan County is the only natural protection area of Mandarin ducks and rhesus macaques worldwide. Despite of a surrounding of green bamboos and clear streams, the county suffered great poverty due to its isolation and backward economy(1). In order to drive its economic development, Pingnan County welcomed the construction of Rongping Joint Chemical Plant (榕屏联营化工厂), the largest potassium chlorate factory in Asia, which fully opened for production in Xiping Village. The Rongping plant opened here in 1994. It had previously been in Fujian's capital, Fuzhou. Officials relocated it to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power from Xiping's mountain streams and promote rural economic development. A state-owned chemicals company based in Fuzhou is the plant's majority owner, although the Pingnan County government held a 30% stake until 2004. The Rongping Plant was providing 1/3 of the county's total tax, which enabled sufficient income for local teachers and carders (ibid). But meanwhile, pollution started to creep upon nearby villages. After the factory opened, local timber stands, bamboo, fruit trees, and crops were noticeably withering and dying. Fish and shrimp sharply decreased in volume. Villagers began to experience various unfamiliar illnesses, including headaches, nausea, chest tightness and itchy skin. Incidents of cancer increased markedly with diagnoses in Xiping Village surging from 1 death between 1990 and 1994 to 17 between 1999 and 2001 (ibid). Noticing these health problems, Xiping villagers voluntarily collected waste water and residue discharged by the plant for an official test, which indicated a dangerous level of pollutants, with hexavalent chromium 10 times higher than normal. Chromium pollution may cause diarrhea and skin allergy, and corrode the respiratory passage. It is also known as a carcinogen (ibid). The villagers believed that the pollution actually commenced in 1992 with the construction of the first stage of the plant, and the second stage, completed in 1998, brought the most serious harm.(2). They linked the damage to their life to the plant and complained to the township and county governments as well as environmental authorities. In January 1995, the plant made a one off compensation to some villagers for their loss of crops, and since then no villagers had received any further compensation.(1) Early 1999, Mr. Zhang Changjian, a local ""barefoot doctor"", who was among the first to notice the pollution, organised a letter writing campaign to various government agencies trying to obtain relief. He continued to organize and send a formal petition to China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) in 2001. SEPA, feeling the attention national media paid to the villagers' actions, listed the plant one of the 55 worst polluters in China. In 2002, the Beijing-based Centre for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims (CLAPV) got involved in assisting the villagers (2). Professor Wang Canfa, founder of the centre, inspected the area with a team of environmental experts and journalists.(3) In June the same year, 1,721 plaintiffs, represented by Zhang Changjian and four other villagers, filed a class action lawsuit against Rongping Chemical Plant in the Ningde Municipality Intermediate People's Court. After a long wait of 2 years, a court session opened and confirmed the environmental damage caused by the defendant. The compensation ordered by the court, however, was 249,736 yuan, which only accounted for 1.8% of the plaintiffs' required amount of 13,534,640 yuan. Both parties disagreed with the sentence and consequently appealed to the Fujian Provincial High People's Court.(1) Three years later, the Fujian Provincial High People's Court's final judgment ordered Rongping Plant to immediately cease the infringement; to compensate villagers 684,178.2 yuan for their losses to crops, bamboo, timber and so on; and to clean up its chromium-containing waste.(2) The compensation equates to roughly 397 yuan per plaintiff, earning the so-called landmark environmental case an ambiguous victory.(4) The final execution of compensation and legal cost did not take place until 2008.(5) The plant provides 1/3 of the county's annual tax and other revenues, and this economic benefit to the local government secures its operation and makes judgment difficult to obtain. The plaintiffs criticised the local government for continuously taking the side of the plant; for example, when they went to the county centre to raise funds for the lawsuit and disseminate knowledge on environmental protection, the government accused them of conducting illegal fundraising and confiscated the donation box. Another striking way of silencing opposition happened when China Central Television's News Probe made a programme on Nanping's pollution; the day of the screening of the show, the county experienced an unexpected power cut.(1)",pingnan-pollution-case,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Since the beginning of gas extraction (1992) over 13 billion cubic meters of gas have been produced in the Voelkersen field (near Bremen, Lower Saxony) by RWE Dea AG an international oil and gas company headquartered in Hamburg. The firm has applied hydraulic fracturing, (short fracking, extracting natural gas from shale rock), which creates contamination of surrounding water sources. The contaminated water must be removed and stored safely. For doing so, the RWE Dea has build a 22 km long waste water pipeline close to Voelkersen. This pipeline passes through a water conservation area. Water containing benzene has leaked through for a long time from these waste water pipes. After 10 years of usage, the pipeline plastic can no longer stay intact and starts leaking benzene. In Novermber 2011, an anonymous whistle blower the local branch of Friends of the Earth Germany about the leaking of benzene from the pipeline. The subsequent investigations revealed that benzene leakes from the pipeline at nearly every measuring point. Later another anyonmous tip revealed that not only benzene but also mercury leakes from the pipeline. These incidents and two fracking related earthquakes with magnitudes between 2,5-2,8 in 2011/2012 have created a massive mobilization against fracking in the region. Local initiatives (http://www.nofracking.de/; Gegen-Gasbohren.de), local and national environmental justice organisations (e.g. Greenpeace), political actors (Alliance 90/The Greens), and media (e.g. Weser Kurier) mobilized against fracking. Many of them in collaboration with each other. The public scrutinizing of the waste water line at the edge of the water reserve in Voelkersen has had some success. The pipeline and similar ones in Lower Saxony have been removed. All contaminated areas will be rehabilitated. The compression of the reservoir water in the water protection area has been (temporarily) stopped.

"The Ban Chaung coal mine is a large open-pit mine that, according to civil society reports, has caused severe livelihood loss and environmental degradation, but also strong resistance and mobilizations by locals to stop the unsustainable project [1]. In June 2017, representatives of indigenous Karen filed a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand, alleging human rights violations caused by the activities of the Thai mining companies [2]. According to the complaint, the mine has illegally seized villagers' land, damaged the livelihood of locals, and polluted water bodies and the air. No less than 16,000 people from 22 villages in the Ban Chaung area are impacted or expected to be affected [1,2,3].The coal deposits at Ban Chaung were first surveyed under Burma's past military regime during 2003, 2006 and 2007. Mining permits covering 2,100 acres (ca.850 ha) were granted to the Myanmar Mayflower Mining company during 2010-2011, in an area heavily affected by past fighting between the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Myanmar Army [1]. In 2011, Thai survey teams arrived at the area to make plans for a road to transport coal out of the area [4] and agreements between the Myanmar and Thai companies to operate in the area were consequently made. Company representatives eventually told villagers about the plans, however, at that stage decisions were already made, documents a report [4]. Mining began on a small area around the time of the preliminary ceasefire agreement in 2012 and brought grave consequences to the villagers. One villager said: ""After the ceasefire was signed, I thought I would live peacefully. But I don't think that anymore [...] This mining project is worse than the civil war."" (cited in [4], page 12). (for a detailed Project Timeline, see [1], for an overview of company involvement see Project Details (below) and [2])The project was pushed forward without Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC), with no Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and with severe impacts on people's traditional culture and their fishing and farming-based livelihoods depending on a healthy environment, document several reports and complaints [1,2,3]. Their land, orchards and gardens were seized without prior notice and permission [2,3]. While a few have received some compensation after their land was taken, others haven't received anything at all. The mine has also caused an influx of outsiders, both of workers and soldiers protecting the mine. Villagers feel insecure and intimidated [1,2,3]. According to the reports, the rivers used by locals for drinking, bathing, fishing and swimming were polluted from toxic mining waste, dumped by the companies into the streams. During rains, mining pits fill up with dirty water that is than pumped out by the companies onto farmland and streams [2,3]. Fish stocks have disappeared and people in the area have fallen ill and suffer from skin diseases [3]. Water quality tests conducted by NGOs in 2014 showed high acidity at dangerous levels for health and the environment [1,2]. People are furthermore constantly exposed to air pollution from noxious fumes [3]. The waste piles, dumped in the village area, burn frequently and smolder and the smoke makes living close to the mine unbearable [2]. In 2015, things got worse, when coal fires started to burn uncontrollably, releasing much toxic fumes that impact people and the environment. While the company, every now and then, has responded to the complains by trying to control the coal burning, uncontrolled fires continue to appear [3]. Impacts are expected to further increase, once the mining area is expanded. Currently, only about 64 acres are mined. Despite of agreements with KNU officials in 2014 to not further expand the mine, the company has apparently presented a revised map with an expansion area occupied by villagers' school, church, playground, houses and plantations [2]. In April 2015, the Ministry of Mines announced to revise the contract to not expand the project beyond 612 of ""vacant land"", which however is used by villagers for rotational farming [2]. Furthermore, the mine is developed in a former conflict zone, to which some internally displaced people from the civil war haven't yet returned. After the mine is fully developed, they may be unable to do so [2,3]. Mobilizations against the coal mine have started since the beginning of the mining activities. For instance, villagers blocked the road construction and the company was unable to finish it [1,2]. Civil society organizations have supported them and have conducted detailed research on the project during 2012-2015. Their findings on the mine's harmful development were published in a report entitled ""We used to fear bullets, now we fear bulldozers"" [see 1]. Following the pressure of frequent protests, blockades and increased media coverage on the controversial project, the mine was suspended a few times [2]. In January 2014, KNU officers ordered a suspension, which apparently was ignored by the Thai East Star company [2]. In early 2017, the mine was put on hold after Tanintharyi Region's minister for resources and environmental conservation inspected the mine and found waste water being dumped into the Ban Chaung Creek [5]. According to the civil society group Tarkapaw Youth Dawei, no less than 37 letters were sent to the government before this temporary halt of the mine was achieved [6].In June 2017, 153 representatives, with support of the local groups Tarkapaw Youth Group, Spirit in Education Movement and the organization Inclusive Development International (IDI), filed a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand (NHRCT). NHRCT has the power to investigate and intervene into the extra-territorial actions of Thai companies. The village representatives called upon the Commission to investigate the companies associated with the mining activities for human rights violations [2]. Among the alleged violations are the right to self-determination, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to health and the right to an effective remedy [2,3]. An initial hearing was conducted by the NHRCT in September, 2017 [5,7]. While the companies have stopped the operations temporarily, the remaining coal piles continue to burn and pollute the environment, locals reported [6].Meanwhile, several other bottom-up mobilizations have followed. For instance, in May 2018, over 500 villagers urged directly the President to stop the mining operations [6]. Furthermore, following two years of research, the indigenous communities of Bau Chaung presented in 2018 a unique report on the ethnobiological knowledge and diversity of the area. The report demonstrates ""the enormous amount of indigenous knowledge that local communities hold over their territories"" [8, page 4] and emphasizes the importance of respecting villagers' indigenous beliefs, customs and practices on their ancestral lands for their livelihoods as well as for the conservation of the unique cultural landscapes and ecosystems in which they live [see 8 for details]. Villagers and civil society groups call on the stakeholders involved to stop the harmful mining project, to redress the damages caused, to establish a different development path for Tanintharyi region and to raise awareness about the harmful impacts of coal mining on people and the environment [1].",ban-chaung-coal-mine-karen-state-myanmar,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The outbreak of itai-itai disease, which is the most severe stage of chronic cadmium poisoning, took place in the Cd-polluted Jinzū River that flows from Gifu Prefecture to Toyama Prefecture. The cause of the disease was discharge from Kamioka Mine. The name itai.itai means ""it hurts-it hurts"", this name was given  by a newspaper to a disease that later was known to be originated by cadmium poisoning in this area of the Toyama Prefecture where  the river was contaminated by slag from the mine upstream; as a consequence, the soil in rice paddies was polluted with heavy metals including Cd through irrigation water from around 1910 to the 1960s. Farmers and peasants who used the water of the Jinzu River for agriculture and fishermen who fished those same waters noticed decreases of crop yields and catch of fish and established an Association for Fighting against Mining Pollution in 1932. During World War II, there was more production of zinc and more waste from the mine dumped into the Jinzu River. Agricultural damage in terms of rice production and damage to the fishery  increased. The disease also increased but until the 1950s its cause was not identified as cadmium pollution. Later, the affected residents successfully sued the polluters, the Mitsui company, to make their claims public and receive compensation for damages. This was one of the so-called 'four major pollution-related lawsuits' of the 1970s: Itai-itai disease, Minamata disease, the second Minamata disease in Niigata prefecture, and Yokkaichi pollution. (Kaji, 2012). ============================================= In 2006 the Itai-itai-byo Taisaku Kyogikai (Council on measures to aid Itai-itai disease victims) published a pamphlet to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its establishment on Nov. 14, 1966.  The Toyama-based council mainly comprises victims of Itai-itai disease. The pamphlet contains the testimonies of 56 people who discuss the half-century of efforts to provide relief for victims. Efforts have included court battles with Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., the company responsible for discharging pollutants containing cadmium into the river. In 1972 the survivors and their families had become the first pollution victims in Japan to win a lawsuit against a major company. On Nov. 12,  2016 a monument honoring the council's past activities was unveiled at a ceremony in the city. In the commemorative pamphlet, Ryoshin Takagi, the deputy head of the council, recalled his elementary school days. ""Many in the neighborhoods suffered pain in their bodies and were bedridden,"" the 86-year-old wrote. According to Takagi, even after academics put forth the theory that cadmium caused the disease, sufferers and their family members kept its existence quiet for various reasons stemming from fear. Locals were concerned that the region's rice would stop selling and women would stop coming to the area to marry once word of the disease spread. Fears continued to grow. ""We knew it was no coincidence that residents of areas relying on water from the Jinzugawa river were developing the disease,"" Takagi said. The pamphlet carries an essay by Tatsuru Shimabayashi, a lawyer who died aged 82 in April this year. According to Shimabayashi, a June 1971 ruling by the Toyama District Court in favor of Itai-itai-byo sufferers marked a historical turning point. He wrote, ""I believe the true nature of the pollution lies in the fact that the victims have suffered for life, and that local governments and the company responsible for the damage have ignored the victims' suffering.""  This is not the only case of cadmium pollution in Japan (e.g. An-naka zinc factory) or in the world. For instance, The Hindu reported in 2003 that  the rice-eating population in Kerala could have suffered very much like those  in the Fuchu area of Japan. Exposure to cadmium in Itai-Itai victims came from consuming rice from paddies that were contaminated with mining wastes. The estimated cadmium intake of Itai-Itai victims was 1 mg/day. This was 20 times the maximum permissible limit and 200 times the normal intake in unexposed populations. The number of people affected  (mainly women) peaked in the years between 1955-1960. It caused severe bone deformities that resulted in pain upon walking, particularly in the joints, a waddling gait, and chronic renal disease.",itai-itai,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"In the early 2000s, after being rejected from operating in the United States due to being considered a risky activity, the main drivers of the Costa Azul Consortium, a subsidiary of the Mexican company IEnova, which in turn is a subsidiary of the American company Sempra Energy, began the construction of a regasification plant in Ensenada, Baja California, which began operations in 2008 [1]. This plant is designed to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels from Asia and transform it from a liquid to a gaseous state, and then export it to the United States through a network of pipelines also owned by Sempra Energy. This multinational was one of the first foreign companies to distribute natural gas in Mexican territory, with the EcoGas network in Mexicali, and also has several power generation projects in Baja California: a combined-cycle thermoelectric plant in Mexicali and a wind farm in La Rumorosa (Sierra Juárez Energy), both for exporting electricity to the United States, and a photovoltaic park (Rumorosa Solar) to supply the local market [2].  The company currently has a new project consisting of expanding its regasification plant to add liquefaction capacity, meaning that instead of importing LNG vessels and transforming them into a gaseous state, it will now be able to receive natural gas from the United States (including fracking basins located in Texas), convert it to a liquid state (cooling it to -162°C), and export it in vessels to Pacific countries. If this project materializes, Sempra will transform Baja California into a platform for the export and import of natural gas between the United States and the Pacific, or in other words, as a ""right of way"" for gas between both spaces. Through these projects, the transnational company will be able to change the direction of its pipeline flows as needed: when it is cheaper to buy energy in Texas, it can transport it to Ensenada and use its liquefaction plant to export it to the Pacific; when it is more profitable to acquire it in a country in the Pacific Basin such as Indonesia, Russia, or others, it can receive it at its regasification plant and then transport it through Baja California territory and export it to the United States. It also plans to build a storage terminal for refined petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and ethanol) called Baja Refinados [2] [3].  Sempra Energy, through its subsidiary IEnova, has signed preliminary agreements with affiliated companies of Total, Mitsui, and Tokyo Gas for the 20-year sale of all liquefied natural gas (LNG) that it intends to convert at the plant during phase 1 [4]. The French oil multinational Total also acquired a 16.6% stake in the plant project, similar to its involvement in the other liquefaction plant project, Cameron LNG, owned by Sempra Energy in Louisiana [5] [6]. Sempra also has a contract with Chevron for its subsidiary Chevron Combustibles de México to use approximately 50% of the storage capacity of a new marine terminal for the receipt, storage, and delivery of hydrocarbons that Sempra plans to build next to its gas plant [14]. These projects pose potential environmental impacts due to methane and other toxic gas emissions (benzene), as well as impacts on marine ecosystems from the discharge of wastewater at very low temperatures into the sea. This could affect fishing, tourism, and recreational activities as well as the reproductive process of gray whales, due to the daily circulation of vessels [2]. It also poses significant risks as industries of high risk, which are further compounded by the proximity of the projects in an unstable geological area with faults and fractures, where there is a reception and storage facility for large quantities of LPG [1] [2].  Since 2003, there has been local opposition to the regasification plant from the residents of the Bajamar housing complex, located less than 4km from the plant. They filed several legal motions and obtained an injunction that grants the definitive suspension of the plant [7]. Additionally, there is a land dispute because this plant was built on several lots, including lot number 2, which belong to the Agrícola Costa Azul colony, for which the businessmen of this colony filed a complaint with the Agrarian Court denouncing the anomalous legal situation of the property titles and the erroneous physical location [8].  With the announcement of the plant expansion project, a broader mobilization began by the population of Ensenada through the social movement Ensenada Resiste. Academic staff at the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE) and the University of Southern California (USC) have also expressed their opposition to the expansion of the natural gas plant, denouncing the environmental impacts it would cause and the fact that the project is not part of any national energy plan and is contradictory to an energy transition process [9]. The population has denounced and protested against the citizen consultation process carried out fraudulently and illegally in October 2020. There were several irregularities and lack of transparency in the voting process (ballots had no serial number, erasable ink was used, and polling stations were not fully identified in the brochures). They also denounced that the consultation had been manipulated by the fact that the Sempra company conditioned the vote, with coercion from the mayor of Ensenada, Armando Ayala, offering to allocate 430 million pesos for the construction of 24 public works if the population accepted the project during the consultation [7] [10].",planta-de-licuefaccion-de-gas-de-sempra-energy-en-ensenada-baja-california-mexico,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The extensive monocultures of eucalyptus have ecological, economic and social effects. Eucalyptus plantations lead to the loss of biodiversity and wildlife, soil degradation and the depletion of water resources (due not only to the amount of water used but also to the addition of agro-toxics) (8). In spite of this, eucalyptus is largely used by the paper industry because of its rapid growth and its ability to adapt to all types of ecosystems [13] [11]. Since the 1980s, investments in the paper industry in Brazil have importantly increased, especially in the states of Bahia and Espiritu Santo [5] [9]. In 1982, Bahia consolidated itself as the paper industry's second most important state in the country [14]. It is home to many of the leading companies in the paper industry, including Aracruz Celulose and Bahia Sul Celulose. Both have large plantations of eucalyptus distributed throughout the state [8].The purchase and expropriation of land by companies has been conducted extensively in order to increase production. Even though this entails great socio-economic and cultural consequences for the local populations, it is supported by the Brazilian state. Eucalyptus plantations today cover more than 7.5 million hectares of Brazil. Eucalyptus monocultures have however destroyed many local practices, have been detrimental to local economies and endangered the survival of the local people [9].In this context, numerous groups and organizations came together to stop its expansion.  One of these activists was Rosane Santiago Silveira, who was brutally tortured and murdered in her home at Nova Viçosa in the State of Bahia (BA) on January 29, 2019 [2] [3] [7].According to her son, before her murder, Rosane had received death threats which at that time she denounced in the local government. Despite this, no actions were taken by the local authorities to prevent her brutal assassination [6] [10]. Rosane, also known as ""Rô Conceiçao"", was 59 years old and was active in the struggle to create an association to protect the environment on the Island of Barra Velha against the eucalyptus expansion. Eucalyptus expansion is still increasing in Southern Bahia. According to the Private sector, there is a plan to increase eucalyptus plantations reaching 1 million hectares in the State of Bahia in 2020. Rosane was also a member of the Cassurubá Extractivist Reserve Council. Her main aim was to create a ""Reserva Extractivista"" to protect the area [16]Crime investigators deny that her murder was caused by her political and environmental activism [4] but according to her family and the community there is no doubt that she was murdered because of being an environmental defender.  According to her son, Rose was found dead in her house, with hands and feet tied and wounded, a cloth around the neck and stab wounds and gunshots at the head.

"Voisey's Bay nickel mine in Labrador was strongly opposed by Innu and Innuit when explorations and operations began. The mine is now being expanded by Vale, a Brazil based global mining company to include underground mining operations which will produce cobalt, which is in demand for use in cell phones and electric car batteries. The Voisey's Bay nickel-copper-cobalt mine is located in northern Labrador, about 35km southwest of Nain and 350 km north of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the eastern edge of a vast expanse of northern wilderness. Rich in resources, the region has seen thousands of mineral claims. These offer revenue for the provincial government (Arctic Circle, n.d.). The project encompasses a mine and concentrator at Voisey's Bay, port facilities in nearby Anaktalak Bay and a processing plant at Long Harbour, on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula (Higgins, 2011). The bulk carrier ship Umiak I was built to transport ore from the mine. (Wikipedia, Voisy, n.d.) Voisey's Bay is a ""6,000 tonnes-per-day facility produces two types of concentrate: nickel-cobalt-copper concentrate and copper concentrate. Voisey's Bay is a fly-in/fly-out operation (Vale, n.d.). ""Workers at Voisey's Bay are flown in from other communities in the province, and reside at a work camp while onsite. There are no current plans to build a permanent settlement at Voisey"" (Wikipedia, Voisy, n.d.). ""This deposit is considered to be one of the most substantial mineral discoveries in Canada in the last 40 years and is estimated to contain 141 million tonnes at 1.6% nickel"" (Wikipedia, Voisy, n.d.). ""The prospecting company Diamond Resources discovered the mineral reserves in 1993 and sold them to Canadian mining company Inco (now Brazilian-owned Vale Inco) in 1996 for $4.3 billion"" (Higgins, 2011). Voisey's Bay is on the territory of both Innu Nation and the Nunatsiavut (Inuit) and subject to land claims by both peoples. The Innu never signed treaties and do not fall under Canada's Indian Act, they have no reserves nor treaty rights (Innes, 2001). Vale has negotiated separate Impacts and Benefits Agreements (IBA) with the Innu and the Nunatsiavut (Vale, n.d.). ""To the Innu, this land is known as Kapukuanipant-kauashat, or as Eimish (or ""Emish""). To the Inuit, it is Tasiujatsoak. Settlers called it Voisey's Bay after the family that established a trading post here in the early 1900s, and this is the name that found its way onto the government maps and into public consciousness in November 1994, when Diamond Fields Resources made a significant mineral find"" (Innes, 2001). ""The mine currently employs about 500 people, more than half of whom are Inuit or Innu, while more than 80% of contracts are with Indigenous-owned and operated businesses"" (Jamasmie, 2018). ""The resulting report of the Environmental Assessment Panel was considered by the Innu to be a valuable document. The Panel made 107 recommendations, to be met before the project went ahead. Unfortunately, the two most important of these, that a land claims agreement and an impact-benefits agreement be negotiated with the Innu and the Inuit prior to any further development were ignored by both levels of government (Mining Watch, 1999). The Innu and Inuit have tried many means to halt the company's construction plans, including an unsuccessful appeal to Newfoundland Supreme Court. Timeline of the issue: 1977: The Innu Nation first filed their land claims with the Canadian Government (Arctic Circle, n.d.) 1993: Orr deposit discovered. November 1994: Diamond Fields Resources (DFR) made a significant mineral find in the area (Innes, 2001). Fall 1994: Without consultation with the Innu or Inuit, DFR began its exploration work in earnest. This work began with no prior scientific research to compile the baseline data necessary to assess the impacts of their activities on Innu land and the area wildlife. February 1995: Mushuau Innu First Nation Council issued an eviction order to Diamond Fields Resources. ""About 100 Innu from Utshimassit traveled to Eimish by snowmobile along the ice-bound Labrador coast. Once at the site, Chief Simeon Tshakapesh and Daniel Ashini delivered an eviction notice to the chief geologist, giving the company twenty-four hours to shut down operations and leave Innu land (Innes, 2001). The Innu ""demanded that DFR stop drilling until they had prepared an environmental and cultural protection plan. The threat to economic development was, however, too much of a concern for the Newfoundland government. The Premier of Newfoundland sent in 56 officers of the RCMP (Arctic Circle n.d.). There was a two-week standoff between the Innu and the RCMP (Innes, 2001). An attempt by the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu Nation to reach a negotiated agreement with the company ended abruptly when they made it clear that the company would not recognize Aboriginal rights and resumed exploration activity (Arctic Circle n.d.). ""Although the Innu action against the company failed to achieve the practical outcome the Innu desired, it was singularly important in many other ways. Publicly, the action established the Innu as one of the principle actors in the drama unfolding around the mineral discovery, but it also helped to unify the Innu response to the project. Innu leaders, spokespeople, elders, and community members consistently articulated positions that centered on the effects of the project on Innu rights, Innu land, and the Innu way of life (Innes, 2001). Fall 1995: The Innu Nation, under tremendous pressure to respond to this mining activity decided to set up a Task Force on Mining Activities. 1996: Inco Ltd. acquired the rights to the Voisey's Bay mine and took over operations. 1997: Innu and Innuit negotiations with Inco broke down after the company ""refused to halt construction work on the project. The Innu and Inuit want work stopped until agreement is reached on an environmental assessment and a deal on compensation. The Innu and Inuit of Labrador staged a joint protest at the massive mining development at Voisey's Bay. Inuit arrived from Nain to set up a protest camp, and more than 250 Innu from Davis Inlet and Sheshatshiu joined them"" (The Nation, 1997). 2005: Mine opened.October 2006: Inco was purchased by Vale. Summer 2006: Workers at the site went on strike. A core issue in the dispute was pay equity with workers at Vale Inco's facilities in Greater Sudbury, Port Colborne and Thompson (Wikipedia, Voisy, n.d.) 2014: The Long Harbour Processing Plant (LHPP) began operations. June 2018: Premier Dwight Ball announced that Vale was moving forward with its underground mine at Voisey's Bay (Wikipedia, Voisy, n.d.). Transiting Voisey's Bay nickel mine from open-pit operations to underground will cost about $2 billion and is expected to extend its productive life to 2035... Once operational, and including the Long Harbour processing plant, direct employment will hit 1,700 jobs. Vale will partly finance the expansion through a pioneering agreement to sell future production of cobalt from the Canadian operation to Wheaton Precious Metals and Cobalt 27. Both companies will make a combined purchase equal to 75% of Voisey's Bay cobalt production from Jan. 1, 2021 onward. (Jamasmie, 2018). Faced with a depressed market for nickel and other minerals...'Vale is looking to sell unmined cobalt, worth hundreds of millions of dollars"" (Roberts, 2018). ""The streaming deal – making an upfront payment in exchange for future production – is for $690 million of cobalt and comes as speculation rises over a shortage of the metal needed to make batteries that has been pushing companies to secure long-term supply. Cobalt is ""one of the crucial elements in batteries for cellphones and electric vehicles"" (Jamasmie, 2018). Income from cobalt is a way for Vale to finance construction of the underground mine at Voisey's Bay (Roberts, 2018). Vale has hired the Bank of Montreal to raise around $500 million from bidders for cobalt that will be produced at Voisey's Bay. The deal would be for 3,000 tonnes annually (Roberts, 2018) Vale claims to be ""planning to continue working with Innu and Inuit partners for the new expansions"" (Vale, n.d.). ""Johannes Lampe, president of the Nunatsiavut government, said the announcement marks 'a happy day for Labrador Inuit,' with new opportunities for direct employees and contract jobs in transportation and infrastructure around the site. Labrador Inuit are guaranteed jobs in the new operations under the impacts and benefits agreement the Nunatsiat government has signed with Vale. The Innu government also has an agreement with the company"" (McKenzie-Sutter, 2018). Given that IBAs have been ignored before in this conflict, there is reason to doubt this. In addition, the risks are high. ""History has proven that underground mining tends to be quite hazardous and risky... there are higher numbers of incidents like explosions with underground mines compared to open pit mines"" (McKenzie-Sutter, 2018).",vale-mining-in-voisys-bay-labrador,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Red Dog Mine is one of the world's largest zinc and lead mines, located about 170 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle in northwest Alaska, near Kotzebue. The mine opened in 1989 and it is still operating, under an operating agreement between NANA, the land owner or the Alaska Native Regional Corp, and the mine operator -- Teck Resources Ltd [1] [2] [4]. ""Zero harm, zero injuries, whole families. We embrace practices that protect people, property and the environment, wherever we are"", states NANA's website [4]. However, in its years of operating, the Red Dog mine, has realeased about millions of kg of toxic chemicals, which were spilled to two nearby  small towns Kotzebue and Kivalina. This comes from  escaped dust from the haul road from the mine towards the coast. Both the towns are situated 120 km south of the mine [1] [2]. The are 83,578 pounds of cadmium compounds, 1,435,542 pounds of chromium compounds, 415,802 pounds of mercury compounds, and 319,192,113 pounds of lead compounds, all of which was reportedly disposed of on-site at the mine. The towns are considered the most polluted communities in the USA due to the mine toxic activities over the years [2]. In the villages residents practice a traditional way of life and relay on the surrounding environment for their livelihoods and health, but the enormous toxic realise from the mine contaminated their lands and waters [1]. Residents and environmentalists from the Alaska Community Action on Toxics group argue how the company releases the toxic compounds without reporting it to the official governmental environmental agency: ""The mining industry will make the argument this is just waste rock, but the fact is they are bringing this large amount of heavy metal-concentrated ore to the Earth's surface"" [2]. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Red Dog Mine creates more toxic waste than any other operation in the United States. But, almost all of the toxic waste reported by Red Dog are rocks (waste rock and tailings) which do not leave the site, but that ""naturally"" contain >2% sulfide minerals [2].  The environmentalists furthermore fear that  these lands, in and around the mine as well as in areas adjacent to the road used to haul ore from the mine to the coast, are going to be contaminated for the foreseeable future [2]. In the country, Toxic realeases Inventory is needed and requires industrial facilities involved in manufacturing, mining, power generation and other sectors to report exactly how much toxic material, from a list of about 650 toxic chemicals, they release into the environment. The goal is to alert communities to the possibility that they might be exposed to toxic chemicals, and the inventory has often been used by environmental organizations, community groups, and labor unions across the country [2].However, in Kotzebue, city officials do not appear to be informed nor familiar with the releases nor recognize the danger of contamination. ""As far as I know it is safe,"" said Kotzebue City Manager.  ""And as far as toxic releases, I wasn't aware of anything like that."" But in Kivalina there is growing concern about the mine [1] [2]. In 2004, Kivalina residents filed a lawsuit over pollution violations at the Red Dog Mine [6] [7]. The Teck Cominco Ltd company has agreed to pay up to $120 million for a wastewater pipeline to settle a lawsuit by Kivalina villagers who claimed mine pollution was fouling their drinking water and the fish that are a staple of their diet [8]. The 2004 lawsuit alleged that the Red Dog Mine had thousands of Clean Water Act violations in the late 1990s [8]. Still the mining sector claim this water is not contamined, but people of Kivalina are not convinced [2].""We started hearing and seeing the people getting sick, especially the newborns, with issues we have never seen before"" [...]""We believe it is from drinking [water contaminated by] the Red Dog Mine over the last 25 years"" [2]. The village is trying to get the EPA to test for possible contamination in the village and surrounding area [2]. A 2001 National Park Service report documented elevated levels of lead, cadmium, and zinc in vegetation along the road, as well as near the storage area by the port. Concentrations of lead and cadmium, the National Park Service report stated, exceed levels of permitted concentration [3]. The mine is expected to continue operating until 2031, due to expansions from Red Dog's original deposit into new deposits called Aqqaluk and Qanaiyaq. Currently, all Red Dog production is from those deposits [5].",red-dog-mine-toxic-tailings-to-kotzebue-and-kivalina-alaska-usa,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The Dead Sea has shrunk by 30 percent in the past two decades. In 2013, Israel, Jordan and Palestine signed an agreement on an ambitious and contested project to replenish the rapidly shrinking Sea by transferring in water from the Red Sea along a 110-mile pipeline (1). The proposed pipeline known as  the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance Project (Red-Dead), is meant to help to slow the dessication of the Dead Sea and provide water for Jordanians, Israelis and Palestinians (3).Under the agreement, 300 million cubic metres of water will be pumped each year under the first phase. In its following phases, the Red-Dead project will see the transfer of up to 2 billion cubic metres of sea water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea (3). Analysts have critiqued the project on the basis that it would provide only 10 percent of the volume of water needed to stabilise the Dead Sea, while threatening its unique characteristics, and would not alleviate severe water shortages in the area (1). Environmentalists and scientists have also been strong opponents of the project arguing that the introduction of Red Sea water containing living organisms could have a catastrophic effect on the unique characteristics of the Dead Sea and affect salinity, evaporation rates as well as bacteria and algae composition (1, 4, 6). Some have warned against changes in sea levels which could result in surrounding properties and lands being immersed in water in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Jordan (3). Further, organisations such as FoEME and EcoPeace Middle East criticise the project for failing to address the root causes of the decline of the Dead Sea (2). Indeed, the main cause of the decline is the appropriation of more than 90 percent of water from the Jordan River, its main source of freshwater, to the north for agricultural and domestic use as well as mineral extraction by Israel, Syria and Jordan (1). The distribution of water in the region is a contentious issue, with most of the underground aquifers in the West Bank under Israeli control. Palestinians say they are severely deprived of water resources compared with Israeli settlements in the West Bank, whilst being denied access to the economic potential of the Dead Sea (1).The first stage of the project will start in the first quarter of 2018 and end in the last quarter of 2020. Companies have started to bid to implement and fund the first phase of the project.",red-sea-dead-sea-water-conveyance-project,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The conflict between the Mattaponi Tribe and the construction of the King William Reservoir lasted 22 years, from 1987 to 2009. This dispute illustrates the conflict between providing resources for the ""greater public"" and asserting the needs and the rights of Indigenous people [6].  The people of the Mattaponi Tribe are descendants of the Powhatan Confederacy that resided along the Potomac, Rappahomack, York, and James rivers from the Chesapeake Bay [2]. In 1607, The Powhatan was the first Indigenous group to experience colonization with the settling of Jamestown. The English settlers attempted to take their land and resources; however, the surviving tribes fiercely protected the reservations that they occupy today. The Mattaponi Tribe is located along the Mattaponi River and uses the river and surrounding lands to hunt and fish [2].  This traditional way of life was jeopardized with the interest in building a reservoir, which would later put the Mattaponi River at risk for environmental degradation. This project was proposed by the Regional Raw Water Study Group, which was formed in 1987 by representatives of James City County, York County, Williamsburg, and Newport News [4]. For the King William Reservoir, the head of the project was the city of Newport News. The Regional Raw Water Study Group marketed the King William Reservoir as ""the cornerstone of a strategy to provide an adequate drinking water supply for all the residents of the lower Peninsula"" [6]. However, even though the project was set to be built in King William County, the demand for water was in Newport News and New Kent County. The estimate from the District Engineer reported that the water deficit for Newport News and its partners was around 17 million gallons a day. The reservoir would provide an ample amount of water at around 40 million gallons a day. The King William Reservoir Project called for the construction of a 78-foot-high dam and a 1,500-acre reservoir in King William County [2]. The Cohoke Creek did not have sufficient water flow to fill and maintain the reservoir, so Newport News Waterworks planned to draw up to 75 million gallons a day from the Mattaponi River. This project required two pipelines, one 1.5 miles long that connected the Mattaponi River to the King William Reservoir, and one 11.7 miles long that connected the new reservoir to a tributary of an existing Newport News reservoir in New Kent County [2].  The construction of the reservoir, and subsequent pipelines, posed many different dangers to the surrounding environment. The damming of Cohoke Creek would result in the destruction of more than 400 acres of wetlands and 21 miles of streams [2]. The damming would also affect the surrounding land by flooding 875 acres of upland wildlife habitat and adversely impacting another 105 acres of wetlands located downstream of the dam. This flooding would also cover over 150 archaeological sites, most of which are sacred to the tribes [7].  An influential element in this project is that the Chesapeake Bay has a unique environment since it connects to the Atlantic Ocean. This characteristic means that the rivers that flow into the Chesapeake, such as the Cohoke and Mattaponi, are estuaries. The main rivers that flow into the Chesapeake start from freshwater and transition to salty freshwater and then to saltwater. The specific salt levels are essential for the habitat and for the breeding of a variety of different aquatic organisms. The proposed withdrawals from the Mattaponi River threatened to change the salinity patterns, which would drastically impact the species that rely on the rivers [2]. Since the location of the withdrawals themselves would be in tidal waters, the project would also adversely affect the spawning grounds of the American Shad. The American Shad is a native fish that the tribe ""depends on for both their subsistence and as a source of income"" [2]. In terms of overall environmental impacts, the project's completion would ""result in the greatest permitted destruction of wetlands in the mid-Atlantic area since the enactment of the Clean Water Act"" [7].  Legally, the King William Reservoir Project was extremely complicated because several different state and federal agency approvals were required for the project to begin. Since the dam would be constructed by ""the discharge of dredged or fill material"" into Cohoke Creek, section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires the City to obtain a construction permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers [1]. Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps may not issue a permit for an activity resulting in a discharge into wetlands unless the state where the discharge takes place certifies that the discharge will comply with ""applicable provisions"" of the CWA or until the state waives such certification. The Environmental Protection Agency also has the power to veto any permits granted by the Corps. In addition, in granting the permit, the Corps is required by the terms of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the effects of the project on the human environment and make an environmental impact statement if a significant impact is found. The Corps is also required, by the Endangered Species Act, to take into consideration the species in the area and to make sure that none of them are jeopardized by the project. Finally, the Corps must also ""take into account the effect of the [proposed] undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included or eligible for inclusion in the National Register"" of Historic Places [2]. The National Historic Preservation Act also requires the Corps to provide a public comment period before implementation. This project would also require a permit from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission for the water intake structure and review from the DEQ for compliance with the state's coastal resources management regime [2]. Since the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations established a study-and-consultation process, the Mattaponi Tribe was able to enter the legal conversation as consultants [2].  The Mattaponi Tribe argued that because the King William Reservoir Project was set to be within three miles of the reservation, the 1677 Treaty at Middle Plantation applied. The Treaty of Middle Plantation was created when Indigenous Tribes swore loyalty to the British sovereign in return for being officially granted access to civil courts, as well as hunting rights and permanent ownership of land within a three-mile radius of their towns. This treaty was the platform on which the Mattaponi Tribe fought against the Newport News Waterworks [2]. The Mattaponi Tribe stated how the completion of the King William Reservoir Project would impact their Tribe. The flooding would cause the excavation of vital archaeological resources, resulting in an ""unacceptable and irretrievable loss to the Tribe"" [2]. The Mattaponi made it clear that unless the project could find a way to leave their ancestor's ""sacred resting sites"" unchanged, they would reject any of the proposed plans. Furthermore, the withdrawal of water from the Mattaponi River would likely negatively impact the population that relies on the American Shad. The project would also have a significant impact on the tribe's ability to perform traditional hunting and gathering practices, compromising their traditional way of life. In addition, the location of the reservoir on Cohoke Creek was unacceptable spiritually because it posed a threat to a sacred site located there. Even without the site at Cohoke Creek, the Mattaponi river itself is an essential part of the tribe's spirituality, and the project would alter the river in a way that would be damaging to the relationship between the people and the land. The completion of The King William Reservoir Project would create an irreversible and unmitigable impact on the Mattaponi Tribe.  The conflict was resolved in 2009 after The Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation filed suit against the Army Corps of Engineers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia [6]. They challenged the North Atlantic Division of the Corps' decision to ignore the Norfolk District's recommendation and issue the CWA Section 404 permit for the reservoir project. Eventually, the decision came down to the unjustified destruction of wetlands. This argument was especially strong considering that less damaging practicable alternatives exist that did not pose negative consequences on tribal lands [2]. This case was fought mainly as a legal battle and eventually was won as a legal battle by allies of the Mattaponi Tribe. While it was a victory for the tribe since the reservoir was never built, the case sets an unsettling precedent that shows the strength of Environmental Protection, but also the disregard of Mattaponi and Indigenous rights.",the-mattaponi-tribe-against-virginias-king-william-reservoir-project,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The Aurá dump, situated at the outskirts of Pará's capital Belém, in the neighboring city Ananindeua, has been one of Brazil's largest and most controversial dumping grounds. It was officially closed down for domestic waste disposal in 2015, following a new act in the country's solid waste policy (Lei 12.305).Aurá was opened in 1990 and was initially a landfill for ash and incinerated waste. After functioning as a sanitary landfill for a few years, it degraded and became an uncontrolled landfill overloaded with all types of waste. Between 1991 and 2015, it served as the main dumpsite of the Belém metropolitan area, receiving up to 1,800 tons of waste per day. From at least 2005 onwards, there was no treatment or selective waste collection. Aurá has been frequented by more than 1,800 informal wastepickers, so-called catadores, making it the second-largest Brazilian dump in this regard. From an environmental standpoint, wastepickers' work is very significant and accounts for almost 90 percent of all recycling in Brazil (where only 1,4 percent of all solid waste gets recycled). Their work also has a social dimension: for many catadores it is a means of survival, as the selling of collected materials such as metal or plastic allows them to gain a minimal income. This happens in a context characterized by persistent urban inequality and social marginalization. Some wastepickers even live around dump sites and eat the food collected there. This also happens in Aurá, where subsistence fishing and animal raising are no longer possible due to water contamination. [1][2][3][4][5a][5b][6][7]Precarious social conditions are closely linked to environmental degradation, which has increased along with the amount of waste deposited there. While a 1998 study had already found contaminated leachate in the river basin, problems continued as the site became increasingly overloaded with garbage, affecting the water quality of the entire metropolitan area. Toxic substances accumulated in the soil, impacting animal populations, and water reservoirs used by the local communities, who frequently suffered from diarrhea, dermatitis and other illnesses. [2][6][8][9][10] Due to anaerobic decomposition of organic material, the dumping ground also became a notable emitter of methane with an estimated 480,000 tons released between 1992 and 2017, equivalent to the burning of 34,000 hectares of forest. [11]In 2006, the Canadian company Conestoga Rovers & Associates launched the Aurá Landfill Gas Project, installing a landfill gas collection and flaring system that – over a project duration of 10 years – would capture methane generated at the site before entering the atmosphere and thereby reduce emissions compared to a scenario of uncontrolled release of gas. The project was registered under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UNFCCC, allowing trading of 'Certified Emission Reductions' on the private carbon market. [7] [12]With the adoption of Brazil's new National Solid Waste Policy in 2010 – which came after a period of uncontrolled urban growth and in the run-up of a series of mega-events (Río+20 Conference, FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games) – municipalities were required to adopt integrated waste management plans, leading to the closure of a number of problematic dumping grounds across the country, which were replaced by controlled, usually privatized landfills. The new regulation also provided for the inclusion of affected wastepickers' perspectives, as well as their integration into municipal waste management plans. This would become a major focal point of their revendications. [4][13][14]In the case of the Belém metropolitan area, the Aurá dump was to be closed down for domestic waste disposal from 2014 onwards. While the company CTR Guajará was initially contracted in 2012 to transform the Aurá into a controlled landfill, the contract was canceled by the municipalities of Belém and Ananindeua shortly after due to irregularities in the bidding process. However, CTR continued operating for a while without an environmental license. Political controversies continued when, in 2013, Pará's Public Ministry used an emergency clause to support a new landfill project by the company Revita Engenharia in the neighboring city of Marituba. This was presented as a long-term solution to the waste problem that would eventually allow the complete closure and remediation of the Aurá area. [4][13][15]Since 2012, wastepickers in Aurá have been organizing in the Associação dos Catadores do Aurá (ASCA), which, together with the formation of cooperatives, has increased the visualization of wastepickers in the wider public and created closer linkages with civil society. This has also helped support social mobilization and the articulation of their claims. [5a][16][17]Mobilization intensified when plans to close the Aurá dump and open a new landfill in Marituba were discussed without the participation of catadores. Attempts to prevent wastepickers' access to the Aurá dump had been reported since 2012 and triggered dissatisfaction and first street blockades. [4] In 2013 and 2014, prior to the Aurá dump closure, the local association, together with Brazil's National Movement of the Pickers of Recyclable Material (MNCR; Movimento Nacional dos Catadores de Recicláveis), initiated a series of protests. These included street demonstrations with hundreds of participants, blockades of the BR-316 highway and the dump entrance, as well as an open letter to then-president Dilma Rousseff. The main demands of the movement centered on indemnities for wastepickers affected by the dump closure, maintaining access to the dumpsite as long as their rights were not ensured (e.g. when it comes to measures allowing them to continue recycling work elsewhere and under better conditions), and the formation of a working group that would monitor the implementation of these rights. Protesters bemoaned aggression by the police and claimed that without catadores, the cities would sink in the garbage within weeks. Refusing negotiations with deputies, they also demanded a meeting with Belém's mayor and a revision of the conditions of an earlier signed Conduct Adjustment Agreement (see project details) in order to assure the participation of catadores in municipal waste management plans and more socially inclusive policies (like public contracting of wastepicker associations and cooperatives to formally implement recycling services). [3][4][13][18][19]Moreover, Aurá's wastepicker association accused the Public Ministry of Pará of acting against the public interest since the company Revita Engenharia – concession holder of the new landfill in Marituba – would receive all lucrative waste of the metropolitan region without a proper public bidding process and without a satisfying solution for wastepickers. Losing access to domestic waste at the new site, catadores not only experienced their rights and earlier agreements with the municipalities of Belém, Ananindeua, and Marituba being infringed upon, but they also feared that this would allow the company to dictate the price at the cost of taxpayers. [13] Mobilization also came from residents of Marituba, who had been affected by smell and polluted water since the opening of the landfill and had been repeatedly demonstrating for its closure. [20]From June 2015 onwards, the Aurá dump officially ceased to receive domestic waste – meaning that an estimated 1,100 kg per day from then on went to Marituba – while the disposal of other types of solid waste, e.g. construction debris and inert waste, continued. Despite the official closure, many wastepickers returned to the Aurá dump, often out of extreme urgency as they did not receive support through public social programs. For example, while the municipality of Belém claimed after the closure that dialogue with wastepickers and social inclusion measures had already been initiated, wastepickers argued that measures such as employment in selective waste collection cooperatives and capacity building had only reached a part of the affected population, while the rest continues to struggle. [1] [14] [16]As of 2018, Belém counted 500 irregular sites for waste dumping and numerous streets in which garbage had not been picked up for weeks because collection services were not functioning as they should. [8] Researchers of the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC) in 2018 found the Aurá dump abandoned from public control and called it a running time bomb that has to be remediated immediately in order to prevent further damage. There had been no soil sealing after the closure and leachate continued to come out of the garbage mountains, affecting water resources within the environmental protection zone, the local fauna and food chain, and the communities along the Rio Aurá. In addition, the study detected carcinogenic smoke caused by the combustion of methane gas, a byproduct of organic waste decomposition. [14][21][22] In fact, the entire metropolitan region has been repeatedly affected by the uncontrolled burning of methane gas concentrated on the ground in Aurá and the smoke and air pollution that it generates. [23] In 2019, local residents reported spotting dead fish and shrimps in several of the river basin's streams, possibly caused by the percolation of untreated leachate from Aurá. Public authorities again ordered inspections and initiated viability studies for potential alternative landfill sites. [14][24]In 2019, the situation escalated further when the Marituba landfill suddenly stopped accepting waste from the municipalities because of outstanding debts to its operator, Guamá Resíduos Sólidos, which moreover claimed that the site had exceeded capacity and that an extension was not possible without a series of licenses, studies, and authorizations. Politicians blamed the company for economically abusing the situation, as it demanded R$ 114 per ton of waste instead of the R$ 65 agreed in the contract and the R$ 80 offered by the municipality of Belém. Since 2017, following protests and police operations in Marituba, the Public Ministry of Pará has filed lawsuits against the landfill operator Guamá, the concessionary Revita Engenharia, and Vega Valorização de Resíduos and Solvi Participações (other companies involved in waste management), as well as against ten individuals responsible for these companies (three of whom were arrested). These parties were accused of a series of delicts – ranging from offenses in the licensing process to environmental crimes around inadequate waste treatment in the Marituba landfill. The reported crimes seemed to match those reported in Aurá: waste was dumped on soil that had not been properly sealed and the resulting leachate had not been treated due to a lack of storage ponds, contaminating the Pau Grande stream and an integrated conservation unit in Marituba. The Public Ministry also sanctioned the municipalities of Belém, Ananindeua and Marituba with a fine for every day of non-compliance with their obligations, since they should have implemented measures for integrated solid waste management, selective waste collection, environmental recovery and protection, and the integration of wastepickers since 2014. Confronted with the waste crisis, Belém's mayor and other politicians considered temporarily reopening the Aurá dump until an alternative site could be found – a plan that was vehemently criticized by environmental experts and researchers. [8][14][21][22][25][26][27][28]A recent court decision has prolonged the operation of the Marituba landfill for two more years – increasing the price paid per ton of waste to R$ 90, while also pursuing a more permanent solution. The municipality of Belém in August 2019 used an emergency clause to officially permit the possibility of domestic waste disposal in Aurá and announced the installation of a ""waste treatment cell"" on the site. It was claimed that it would only be temporarily used in case of congestion or incidents in Marituba and be ""controlled"", meaning no irregular waste disposal and no access for wastepickers. [24] [28] [29] [30]As it stands now, this has probably not been the last chapter of Belém's municipal waste crisis. Wastepickers and local communities continue to face numerous social and environmental problems caused by both the consequences of inadequate landfills and irregular dumping and the insufficient creation of future perspectives of wastepickers after by the dump enclosure.",aura-dump-and-the-struggle-of-belems-informal-wastepickers-para-brazil,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The last bastion of Pa'akai, traditional Hawaiian salt-making, is threatened by growth of helicopter operations at Port Allen Airport, which is adjacent to the salt ponds and opened in the 1920s. Pa'akai is hand-made unprocessed salt, exceptionally rich in ocean minerals and renowned by Hawaiians for health, healing and spiritual properties. From the 1800s into the twentieth century salt making took place on all the Hawaiian Islands as documented by land records and newspapers. Yet over time most of the lands used for salt making were lost to industrialization or sold. Hanapepe salt, made near the southern coast of Kauai island, is the only remaining traditionally cultivated salt in Hawaii. It is made in salt beds by highly skilled practitioners, all of whom belong to over 20 families who have passed the craft on through the generations and care for as well as cultivate the salt ponds. Hanapepe salt is not a commercial product; tradition dictates that it cannot be sold, it must only be gifted or in some cases bartered. Maverick Helicopters operates a number of facilities at Port Allen Airport, which were constructed without the requisite permits. A Special Management Area Permit issued by Kauai County in 2005 required the removal of all temporary structures, including sheds and shipping containers, associated with helicopter operations. This requirement was never complied with. Then in June 2019 the company sought permits after the fact for its activities. The firm denies that its activities have negative impacts on salt making. But the practitioners say dust and noise from airport operations, particularly helicopters, do adversely affect salt-making. Concerns over the helicopter operations are not just about loss of resources but also about loss of practice. Hanapepe salt ponds are one of the important cultural sites in Hawaii, an enduring site of traditional teaching. The matter was scheduled to go before the Kauai Planning Commission and salt-making practitioners worked to galvanize community members to oppose Maverick Helicopters' applications for permits.[1]Ku'ulei Santos, vice-president of the salt makers' group Hui Hana Pa'akai, created an online petition for the public to register support of opposition to the permit applications. The petition stated that close proximity of Port Allen Airport to the salt making, with its potential contribution to pollution, noise and chemical runoff had been a longstanding concern for Pa'akai practitioners.[2] The petition was accompanied by a video made by Ku'ulei Santos in which she explains the traditional salt farming techniques that her and other families have practiced for decades.[3] Maverick Helicopters provides tourism flights over Kauai Island and its application for after the fact permits also sought permission to allow them to make modifications to their facility and expand operations.[4] The Kauai Planning Commission hearing to address the issue, held on 25th June, drew a crowd of about 250 residents showing solidarity with the Hanapepe salt farmers. The hearing lasted for five hours during which about 80 people gave testimony, all speaking against the helicopter company's permit request. The multitude of concerns raised included airport operations' contribution to air and noise pollution and drawing excessive vehicle traffic to the area. The petition in support of the salt makers, requesting that the commissioners hold a contested case hearing before deciding whether to grant the permit to Maverick Helicopters, had by this stage garnered over 21,000 signatures from all over the world. This request was granted at the end of the hearing and the Planning Director expressed ""strong agreement"" with the petitioners' request for intervention. The Planning Commission voted unanimously to approve the petitioners' intervenor status and now has to schedule further hearings to resolve the dispute, a process that is expected to take several months or even years to complete.[5] A video shows some excerpts of speakers at the hearing, from hours of emotional testimony. People spoke of the salt-making tradition being at risk of dying out and there being little left for Pa'akai practitioners to pass on to their children and grandchildren, the impact of being flown over by helicopters, sand coming onto the salt beds and both the quality and quantity of salt being affected so that the quantities of salt that could be given away had greatly reduced.[6] Supporters of the salt farmers also described the salt beds, carrying the legacy of 22 families perpetuating the traditions, as a 'jewel"" and a ""living museum"". Ku'ulei Santos' father, Frank Santos, who has worked at the salt beds for 65 years, spoke of how he was taught to respect and perpetuate the culture.[7] Testimony submitted by the Chief Executive of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) highlights the cultural significance of the Pa'akai salt ponds and concerns regarding constitutional obligations to protect the traditional and customary rights of Native Hawaiians. Threats of particulate pollution and chemical run-off from Port Allen Airport were of particular concern to Pa'akai practitioners wishing to maintain the quality and safety of the salt. Proposed expansion of the facility infers continued and potentially expanded helicopter operations that would upend compromises made with the airport to mitigate negative impacts and risk new and increased impacts from a higher volume of airport activities. The OHA testimony stated that salt-making practitioners have raised concerns about possible impacts from existing and expanded helicopter operations for years, arguing that as Maverick Helicopters' permit application provided no information addressing these long-standing concerns, there is no basis for Planning Commission to begin assessment of potential impacts on Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices. Possible measures to ameliorate harmful impacts of helicopter operations could include commitments to work with the Department of Transport and Port Allen Airport operators to minimize ongoing and future dust flow and other sources of contamination that could affect the nearby salt ponds.[8]",hanapepe-salt-ponds-threatened-by-growth-of-helicopter-operations,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"In December 2009, Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) awarded a coalition led by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) a $20 billion bid to build the first nuclear power plant in the UAE. Barakah was chosen as the site to build four nuclear reactors successively, with the first scheduled to start supplying electricity in 2017. Construction of the first reactor begun in 2012. While currently complete, operation of the reactor has been delayed to 2019/ 2020 to complete operator training up to international standards. Uranium concentrates will be supplied by the four major nuclear energy and mining companies (Areva, Rio Tinto, Uranium One, Tenex), potentially driving uranium exploration and mining in the region. Waste disposal options include ""regional cooperation"", which, due to repressive political atmosphere and opacity, coupled with UAE financial resources, risk externalising nuclear waste management and environmental impacts to other countries. Furthermore, due to UAE involvement in the military campaign in Yemen, there is an increased security risk to the nuclear plants due to possible military attacks. Indeed, in 2017, Houthi rebels claimed to have targeted the Barakah plant with missile. A claim that was denied by the UAE.",nuclear-power-plans-uae,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"The Agent Orange was a chemical developed mainly by Monsanto and Dow Chemical. It is a  mixture of two common herbicides (2,4-D and 2,4,5-T ) that were used separately in the United States since the late 1940s. The name was given because of the color of the orange-striped barrels in which it was shipped.  The Dioxin is the deadly toxin in Agent Orange and the responsible for countless health damages. During the Vietnam War (1955-1975) the United States military forces used the Agent Orange to eliminate forest cover and crops in order to deprive of food and hiding places to the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops (Vietnamese communists also known as the National Liberation Front). From 1961 to 1972 the US military forces sprayed more than 19 million gallons of herbicides over 4.5 million acres of land in South Vietnam. This operations was called the Operation Ranch Hand.  From this operation, the term ecocide (Zierler, 2011) was born to denounce the environmental destructions and potential damage. The first test spraying occurred August 10, 1961.  The chemicals were sprayed from aircraft contaminating soil, water, air. Areas of Laos and Cambodia near the Vietnam border were also impacted.. Dioxin later revealed to cause serious health issues among returning U.S. servicemen and their families as well as at a larger scale among the Vietnamese population. Surviving Vietnam veterans in the United States, after many years of organized action, have finally achieved compensation from U.S government. No compensations have been given to vietnamese people. In 2004  the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin (VAVA) filed a lawsuit in the New York court against the companies for liability and claimed the violation of international protocols and conventions. But, in 2005 the judge dismissed the lawsuit ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiff ́s claims. He concluded that the agent orange was not considered a poison under international law. In Vietnam, nearly 4.8 million people have been exposed, causing 400,000 deaths; the associated illnesses include cancers, birth defects, skin disorders, auto-immune diseases, liver disorders, psychosocial effects, neurological defects and gastrointestinal diseases. Research suggests that another six to twelve generations will have to pass before dioxin stops affecting the genetic code.  Nowadays, the dioxin has remain in Vietnam's ecosystem, in the soil and in the food chain.  According with the Aspen Institute ""The half-life of dioxin depends on its location. In human bodies the half-life is 11–20 years. In the environment, the half-life varies depending on the type of soil and the depth of penetration. On leaf and soil surfaces it will last 1–3 years, depending on conditions. However, dioxin buried or leached under the surface or deep in the sediment of rivers and other bodies of water can have a half-life of more than 100 years"".  Waiting for compensation and justice, organizations such as catholic religious group and VAVA constantly organizing charity events and gives help and rehabilitation to affected people.   Agent Orange was banned in 1971. Remaining stocks were taken from Vietnam and the U.S. to Johnston Atoll (U.S. controlled island) where they were destroyed in 1978. On 9 August 2012, the United States and Vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical. Efforts of the US governments in accepting its responsibility have remained slow and minimal.",exposure-to-agent-orange,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Nunavut is the largest in area and the second-least populous of Canada's provinces and territories. It is one of the world's most remote, sparsely settled regions, with a population of 36,000, mostly Inuit, spread over an area of just over 1,750,000 km2. Nunavut is becoming a ""commodity extraction frontier"", with uranium and iron ore resources. Nunavut is also the world's northernmost permanently inhabited place. There is a story of defence of local and ethnic identity, a successful indigenous Land Claim, and there is also a story of mining in the area, particularly in recent years large-scale iron mining by the Baffinland company. There was resistance to uranium mining in Baker Island (Qamani'tuaq) led by the NGO Nunavummiut Makitagunarningit (Makita) [5]. This is also one of the frontiers of climate change impacts, with the ice cover receding and melting (which hampers land communications). Baffin Island in the territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada and the fifth-largest island in the world, with over 500.000 sq. km. The island is inhabited by local Inuits people. Baffin Island has subzero temperatures, ice-blocked sea lanes, and a lack of conventional infrastructure. It is a true ""commodity frontier"". Canadian and international mining companies are attracted by the huge iron ore deposits underneath a frozen landscape (where climate change is making the ice melt sooner every year, and new sea lanes are opening up).The Baffinland company shipped its first load of iron ore from Mary River via Milne Inlet in August 2015 as part of its ""early"" phase. Global prices of iron ore plummeted since the NIRB (the environmental regulations supervisory board) first granted the company its Mary River project certificate in 2012. For that reason, and because the iron ore market is a high-volume, low-margin business, the company changed its plans for Mary River considerably a number of times. The original proposal called for a $5-billion railway to be built from the mine south to Steensby Inlet on the Foxe Basin side of Baffin Island — a plan shelved by Baffinland due to its high price tag.Instead, the company began transporting iron ore along a 100-kilometer tote road between the mine and Milne Inlet, near Eclipse Sound on Baffin's northeast shore.  This was done with enormous trucks that melted the ice, frightened the caribou, disrupted the hunting habit of the Inuits. And then in late 2014, Baffinland proposed significant changes to its project certificate, including:• more than tripling truckloads of iron ore along the road to the Milne Inlet port; • nearly tripling the output of iron ore from Milne Inlet, from 4.2-million tonnes to 12-million tonnes per year; • increasing the shipping season from three or four months a year to ten months a year; • building a second dock at Milne Inlet and a nearby tank farm capable of holding 140-million liters of fuel. The NIRB decided in August 2015 that the proposed changes warranted a full public review, requiring Baffinland to submit a new Environmental Impact Statement [2].  By 2017 and 2018 Baffinlnd appears to be selling the mine to outside interests. The Inuit inhabitants through their councils have agreed to get royalties from the mine, there are however many latent conflicts, which have to do also with a trend among the Inuits to self-governance. The NIRB (Nunavut Impact Review Board ) decided that the increase in production wished for by Baffin should be denied but Inuit pressure made it relent, and it together with the government said yes to an increase request from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. of up to 6 million tons per year for 2019 [4]. The pressure from the local Inuit representatives at QIA s is for jobs and royalties. The NIRB said that Baffinland did not show how it would soften the impact of additional dust along the Milne Inlet tote road and the impact of additional marine shipping out of the Milne Inlet port [4]. Meanwhile, the review board has just begun to look at a separate and much bigger request from Baffinland for the construction of a railway between Mary River and Milne Inlet, with a production increase of up to 12 million tonnes a year [4]. Jobs and royalties will make this area a ""company town"". Several foreign companies, including Arcelor Mittal and possibly Tata, have been trying to acquire the Baffinland assets. By 2020, the expansion of the mine is becoming very controversial. Update May 2021After being postponed for several months due to the restrictions of COVID-19, environmental hearings for the proposed expansion of the Mary River mine restarted in October 2020. In June of 2020, the QIA signed the Inuit Certainty Act (ICA) with Baffinland, which outlines the benefits of the mine to the surrounding communities. Some of these benefits include environmental monitoring, employment, $3 million for childcare infrastructure, and fuel funding for Pond Inlet harvesters [7]. These benefits are received and distributed to communities by the QIA [8]. Many community members believe that the QIA did not explore the full extent of the environmental impacts of the expansion, nor did they involve the local Inuit enough before signing the ICA [7]. The ICA mandates that there will be an adaptive management plan produced to mitigate environmental degradation, but community members worry that it is not enough [9]. Hunters and trappers are already noticing a decline in caribou, and some marine species as a result of the current mining operations, and fear that increased shipping will be harmful to narwhal populations. There is also concern surrounding the construction of a proposed 110km railway and the potential impact it could have on caribou populations as well as permafrost hunting grounds [10]. Between February 4 -11, 2021 a group of Inuit Hunters blockaded the Baffinland airstrip in peaceful protest of the proposed expansion, as well as the role the QIA has played in the process [11]. There were also a number of protests held throughout Nunavut in support of the blockade [12]. The blockade came to a close on February 11th when an injunction was issued authorizing RCMP to remove and detain anyone who continue to block access to the mine [8]. Protesters were also promised meetings with the QIA and the NTI [13].  In March 2021, both organizations announced that they will not support the expansion [14]. The NIRB's final environmental hearings for the proposed expansion restarted April 12th, with 4 days to conclude the technical sessions and 5 days for community roundtables [15]. Scheduled to conclude on April 21, 2021, hearings were suspended indefinitely on April 14th after the confirmation of Iqaluit's first COVID-19 case [16].",iron-ore-nunavut-canada,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM

"Plans to develop a 1000-MW coal fired plant in Sual started in may 2018, when KEPCO announced that was in talk with local partners to invest in this Project: SK Engineering & Construcion (SKE&C). They signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the Government of the Philippines to build two 600 MW coal-fired power plants on Luzon island at an estimated cost of KRW2.2 trillion (US$1.98 billion) [5][6]. There is already a CFPP in Sual, with a net contracted capacity of 2x500 MW. This power plant is owned by Team Energy, which is a joint venture between Marubeni Corporation and Tokyo Electric Power Corporation.On July 2020, Business Mirror wrote that groups belonging to the Save Sual Movement (SSM) and the Phillippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ) , that planned to attend a public hearing, were suprised when the meeting between members of Sangguniang Bayan of Sual and KEPCO was cancelled. Activists of SSM claimed in a Facebook post that any power project with a capacity of 30MW or higher is considered environmentally critical. And the proposed 1000  MW coal plant could have significants environmental impacts. They claim the need for participation of the affected community in the discussion[1]. The Project found special opposition from the Save Sual Movement (SSM) and the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ), claiming that residents already live with smoke and pollution of the Sual Power Station, the larger and most cost-effective coal-fired power station in the country [2], built in 1996. They claim that there is no need of another coal plant, since the electricity demand of the town is only 10 MW[1]. The Sual 1 plant's effluents have already affected the water flow causing risk of contamination of food systems. On October 13th, activists from the Save Sual Movement, Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, and Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development held a rally in front of the Korean embassy in the Philippines, voicing their opposition to the project. Activists also held a demonstration in Sual on the day of the National Assembly hearing on KEPCO as well [3].

"Algeria is the sixth-largest gas exporter in the world, with more than 90% of its pipeline exports going to Spain (34%), Italy (27%), and other European countries.

"Since the mid 1970s, industrial logging on Haida Gwaii, an archipelago of over one hundred islands off the northwest coast of British Columbia, has been contested by the Haida Nation and their supporters. Haida Gwaii is home to the world's best remaining stands of cedar, hemlock and Sitka spruce. Many waves of blockades, popular mobilizations, court battles and inter-governmental negotiations have led to significant wins. Forests have been protected, new forms of co-management have been forged and Indigenous rights have been strengthened. Haida resistance has helped bring about treaty recognition for First Nations in Canada. Conflicts have been sparked again and again over industrial over logging, especially of old growth cedar trees. Communities are opposing the flow of logging revenue accruing away from local communities and concerned about impacts to rivers and salmon. The conflict also involves logging companies repeatedly violating existing agreements and quotas. ""From at least the mid-1970's, the Haida have pursued a number of strategies, from participation in cooperative management processes to illegal roadblocks, in order to reclaim control over the forests and waters of Haida Gwaii. Throughout this period the Haida continued to draw links between their opposition to the environmental damage wrought by resource extraction industries and the nature of colonialism in BC"" (Dean, 2009). Environmentalists helped raise awareness for this Haida-led struggle (Pynn, 2010). Haida resistance led to the creation of the Gwaii Haanas National Park in 1993 which they co-manage with the federal government. This was the first National Park to be co-managed by the Government of Canada and an Indigenous nation (Dean, 2009). Fifty-two per cent of Haida Gwaii is now in protected areas, while another 18.5 per cent is protected through the Haida Gwaii Land-use Objectives Order (Hudson, 2017). Logging companies continue to violate agreements and new blockades and waves of resistance have arisen as recently as 2018. The B.C. government is still ""pursuing profit over culture and community"" by selling logging rights on Haida Gwaii without Haida permission(Kurjata, 2017a). Timeline: 1985: After 12 years of failed negotiations, members of the Haida nation erected blockades on Lyell island (on South Morseby) to prevent the harvest of old-growth forests (Kurjata, 2017). Western Forest Products had the cutting rights to Lyell Island, and Frank Beban Logging Ltd. was the contractor. The approval of new cutting permits touched off the Haida blockade. Though not against all forms of logging, the Haida argued that ""irresponsible logging will not only deplete the old-growth forests but will also alter surrounding ecosystems. This includes the salmon fishery upon which the band's lifestyle is based"" (Tremel, 1985). The company was prevented from logging the area (Tremel, 1985). ""No matter where you stood on the issue at the time, it is generally agreed a quarter century later that the political and geographic map changed in large part due to Lyell Island"" (Pynn, 2010). ""The world watched as proud and defiant Haida -- some elders in ceremonial button blankets -- were arrested one after another"" (Pynn, 2010). A total of 72 people were arrested. A dozen of them were charged and convicted of contempt and given probationary sentences. Much of the B.C. cabinet at the time held shares in Western Forest Products (Pynn, 2010). Unfortunately, these protests pitted different factions against each other on the islands, even within the Haida community (Pynn, 2010). The Lyell Island blockade helped to ""set the mould for the unique way forest protection played out in B.C. over the following decades...When people now see old growth, they think, that should be in a park...Lyell started that"" (Pynn, 2010). The 1985 protests marked the end of one epoch and the beginning of another, an end of the time when governments could ignore First Nations"" (Pynn, 2010) ""The movement on South Moresby was successful because the Haida were able to transform the categories through which the forest was understood and through which decisions about the forest were made. By pursuing both the official processes of consultation and government planning, as well as direct civil disobedience the Haida were able assert their interests in determining the structure of forest policy on Haida Gwaii (Dean, 2009) July 1987: The Canadian and B.C. governments signed a memorandum of agreement paving the way for the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site (Pynn, 2010). 1993: The Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site was created. 2004: A protocol entitled ""An understanding about working together for the well-being of the land, waters and people of Haida Gwaii"" was signed between the Haida and the communities of Port Clements and Masset (Dean 2009). The Supreme court case ""Haida Nation v British Columbia (Minister of Forests), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511"" is the leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the Crown duty to consult Aboriginal groups prior to exploiting lands to which they may have claims. The British Columbia Court of Appeal decided that both the Crown and Weyerhauser Co. are under legal obligations to consult with Aboriginal groups whose interests may be affected (Haida Nation v BC, 2004). March 2005: The Island Spirit Uprising began. For two months Haida and supporters set up a series of roadblocks and halted major logging on Haida Gwaii. The Haida sought to block logging operations by forestry giant Weyerhaeuser (Dean, 2009). With the support of local communities like Port Clemens and Sandspit, Haida members manned blockades at the Yakoun and Hona rivers, set up checkpoints to record the names of people traveling to protected areas, and seized logs on their way out of the designated zones. Feasts were held in various communities on the islands in support of the action and people gathered to show support for the Haida as far away as Toronto and New York (Dean, 2009). ""Many young Haida and non-Haida, joined the blockade as well, tired of watching barges leave the island loaded with valuable cedar, while jobs are hard to come by"" (Ramsay, 2005). These actions were aimed at pushing the provincial government to begin high level negotiations with the Haida leadership. The Haida sought a significant drop in the annual allowable cut and changes to the way resources were managed. The Haida sought to become a major tree license holder on the islands (Ramsay, 2005). ""This action was taken in response to what they felt were violations of a six point agreement the Council of the Haida Nation (CHN) had reached with Weyerhaeuser over logging practices in 2002, as well as the failure of the Government of British Columbia to fulfill its responsibility to consult with the Haida on forestry policy as it had been ordered to do by the supreme court of Canada in a recent ruling"" (Dean, 2009). ""These blockades and demonstrations seemingly succeeded where court action could not since after weeks of negotiation the CHN and the province reached an agreement to resume the land-use planning process and suspend further logging in the contested areas"" (Dean, 2009). 2007: CHN and the provincial government signed the Haida Gwaii Strategic Land Use Agreement, based on the concept of 'Eco-system Based Management' (EBM). 2009: B.C. and Haida sign the 'HISTORIC RECONCILIATION PROTOCOL' stating that resource decisions on Haida Gwaii are to be reached through consensus with representatives from both the government and Haida Nation​ (Kurjata, 2017). 2011: The Haida Gwaii Land Use Objectives Order to set up new protected areas near the Husby's logging operations by Naden Harbour and Eden Lake (Hudson, 2018b). 2017: Conflict erupts again on Haida Gwaii when B.C. government sold logging rights for two blocks of land known as Nadu River and Lawn Hill without permission from or consensus with the Haida. The total stumpage value of the two sites is roughly $1.7 million. The Haida opposed the sale because 50 per cent of the stands in question are cedar, a tree central to Haida culture.​ Haida leader kil tlaats 'gaa said ""We want the local benefits...The future for the island is local control, local opportunity, local benefit, local decision-making"" (Kurjata, 2017a) Letters were sent from the Haida to the two companies who recently purchased logging rights on Haida Gwaii, saying that because the Haida Nation did not approve the purchases, they will not be recognized (Kurjata 2017b). Old Massett launches blockade against logging close to New Town (Hudson, 2017) 2018: A blockade is set up by number of Old Massett Haidas and supporters are calling for an end to logging at Collison Point / St'alaa Kun. ""We're just tired of watching our forests and our future leave on every barge,"" said Lisa White, spokesperson of Haida Gwaii Land Protectors. ""It's been happening my whole life, and then some — it's been 100 years of clear-cutting and logging, and they're leaving us with nothing....It's totally against how our Haida people treated the land, and it's destroying our salmon rivers. We want it to stop"" (Hudson, 2018b). April 2018: Husby Forest Products filed for the injunction against a protest at Collison Point / St'alaa Kun (Hudson, 2018a). Attempts at negotiating a resolution to the blockade have not been successful. Collison Point has been the main logging area for Husby Forest Products since 2011, when the Haida Gwaii Land Use Objectives Order set up new protected areas near the company's earlier operations by Naden Harbour and Eden Lake (Hudson, 2018b). The CHN has said that Husby is harvesting cedar well above agreed to (but nonbinding) harvest limits. ""There's no legal teeth"" said Lisa White. ""In the meantime, they're taking all our cedar"" (Hudson, 2018b). June 2018: Husby Forest Products faced allegations of over-logging on Haida Gwaii and has stopped all logging operations in disputed areas, and as a result has laid off many of its employees.

"A rather small, controversial coal-fired power plant in Kyaikmayaw Township (Mon State) causes concerns and opposition by residents. The plant is part of a cement factory run by the company Mawlamyine Cement Limited (MCL) [1,2]. The facility was approved by the Myanmar Investment Commission through an agreement signed in March 2013, according to which the factory will operate for the next 45-50 years [3,4].Locals found out about the coal power plant when several vessels began transporting coal on the Attaran River in 2015. Initially, they had accepted the project hoping it would provide new jobs, however, they did not know that the facility was powered by coal. ""If we had known earlier, we would have protested then."" [3]. Residents are concerned about the adverse impacts of the plant on local livelihoods and their health. Many have begun to cover their water wells due to fears over rain water polluted by coal fumes [3] and voiced concerns over the declining water quality of the Attaran stream water [5]. Local fishermen complained that fishing has been largely disrupted due to the waves and noise created by the coal vessels [3,4]. Their average daily catch has declined since the vessels increased their services, they say [5]. Local civil society groups and monks further denounced the lack of information provided to villagers and worry about the adverse impacts on the environment such as through carbon emissions, global warming, smog and acid rain [6].Social mobilizations against the project emerged in Kyaikmaraw, Moulmein and Mawlamyine townships where thousands of residents oppose the power plant. In April 2016, a petition with 3,780 signatures was sent to the President's Office, demanding a halt of the controversial project and the use of other fuel instead of coal. On February 18, 2017, around 7,000 residents from seven nearby villages staged a protest against the controversial plant. A second protest was held in July 2017 by about 2,000 villagers, because the president and state government leaders had not responded to their complaints, they said [3]. More protest actions followed [3,4,7].Despite these protests, the factory started commercial operations in April 2017 [2,4]. However, the company has come increasingly under pressure from the regional and Union government. Since June 2017, the Ministry of Natural Resource and Environmental Conservation has asked for monthly EIA reports from the factory [3,8]. In August 2017, the Mon State Parliament requested information on the plant from the Ministry of Electricity and Energy, which replied that MLC had not sought permission to run the 49 KW power plant. The company countered that the factory was powered only by one of the turbines (20MW) for which they have permission [4]. Nevertheless, in September 2017, the Mon State Parliament agreed to debate the legality of the power plant [2] and criticized the lack of transparency of the project [4,7]. According to Mon State lawmakers and the Ministry of Electricity and Energy, the company did not seek approval for the 40+ MW coal power plant, required under the 2014 Electricity Law and the 2016 Mon State medium- and small-scale electricity supply law [2,7]. Furthermore, according to the 2008 Constitution, heavy-scale electricity production (classified as more than 30 megawatts) needs the approval of the Myanmar Union government [4].Attempts to polish the image of the cement factory and its power plant have failed. On 15 November 2017, the company mounted a huge billboard with photos of visiting journalists from the Southern Myanmar Journalist Network (SMJN). The billboard caption said that ""the local reporters are visiting our company as observers"" [8]. However, the journalists' network responded, stating the company did not ask for permission to put up their photos. SMJN has considered filing a complaint against MLC or releasing a statement that would clarify their role and position [8].Negotiations about the controversial power-plant are ongoing. On December 24, 2017 the company met with six representatives of villagers and monks to address their concerns. Discussions included the consideration of alternative power sources instead of coal, which was also a concern of the environmental committee of Mon State Hluttaw [9]. Various other measures to reduce the factory's impact were also to be discussed. As of early 2018, the coal plant remains a contentious project and villagers and government bodies continue to monitor closely the facility [5,9].",controversial-coal-fired-power-plant-built-in-mcl-cement-plant-mon-state-myanmar,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Muzil is a small peninsula of 180 ha located at the south of the City of Pula. Until 2007 Muzil had been a military area after which it became the property of the city of Pula. After the military left the peninsula, the state put it under the control of armed soldiers to prevent its use by the citizens of Pula. The authorities decided to merge works at Muzil with large national tourist development project ""Brijuni Revijera""; the project would have changed the concept of tourism in Croatia. The main idea is the development of exclusive touristic destination by giving under concessions or selling public areas in the Adriatic sea coastal zone. The urban plan proposed by the City of Pula included building of touristic resorts with 2500 beds, golf course and a small harbor on Muzil. According to the plan, the greatest share of the peninsula would be covered by a private golf course, closed for general public. The public green areas are planned on hilly parts of the peninsula, covered with dense vegetation, and therefore not easily accessible to the citizens. In 2009 the citizens of Pula organized ""The Civil Initiative for Muzil"" to oppose the urban plan. The initiative organized several debates and protests, and participated at the public hearing. They argued that the development of Muzil should be gradual and in accordance to the citizens' needs, and asked to be involved in decision-making process. In August 2014, a survey on development of the peninsula was conducted among 400 participants as a part of the EU financed project ""Public voices against corruption in the management of space and natural resources"". According to the survey results, the majority of citizens of Pula were against building of a golf course and demanded a referendum to decide about development of Muzil. In 2014 the State agency for management of state property (DUUDI) published a call for ideas for use of various ex-military locations and among them of Muzil. The citizens' initiative demanded opening the area to public use, currently still under military control. They have been lobbying for political, economic and spatial autonomy of Muzil. In 2014 the citizen initiatives presented the ""Muzil starter"" project providing ideas on how to make temporary use of Muzil infrastructure in order to prevent its further deterioration and before a permanent optimal solution is found. ""Muzil starter"" was largely ignored by the local authorities and DUUDI. In 2015, the City Council of Pula presented ""Spatial Plan of the County of Istria with accompanying strategic study of the environmental impact"" which did not include changes demanded by the citizen of Pula. Announcement of a public call for investors has followed.

"Chemours (formerly known as DuPont) has been polluting the region surrounding its chemical factory in Dordrecht with Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), also known as C8, and GenX since the 1960s [1]. These substances are part of a large collection of (approximately 5,000) per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances, also referred to as forever chemicals because they hardly break down. PFAS are manmade toxic chemicals that do not occur in nature. They are used in many products because of their moisture, grease, and dirt resistance [2]. Chemours/DuPont has been using PFOA and GenX to produce Teflon, on which it long held a patent [3]. For many years, DuPont purchased PFOA from chemical producer 3M, which has also been contaminating the environment [4]. In 2012, DuPont replaced PFOA with GenX (another type of PFAS) for the production of Teflon, because the former was added to the European Union's list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) and monitored under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation [5].Because PFAS hardly break down, they build up in the food chain and the body, damaging people's and animals' health [2]. PFAS exposure negatively affects the immune system and can have severe medical implications, such as liver damage, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and birth defects [6]. DuPont has known the health risks of PFAS since the early 1960s [1]. Internal company experiments conducted on animals and employees in the US demonstrated links between PFOA exposure and cancer and liver damage [3]. It is alleged that the company however  withheld the results of these studies from the public.After DuPont discovered that an unusual number of female employees who had worked with PFAS substances at its American branches during their pregnancy suffered birth defects, female employees were removed from departments working with PFOA at all branches [1]. The women were not informed of the true reason for the transfers. Although DuPont knew of the dangers their employees were exposed to, they repeatedly assured them the substances were safe to work with [1]. An employee of the Dordrecht facility reported having been told by a supervisor that Teflon is safe enough to eat. Yet remarkably many local residents and employees were falling seriously ill.In 1993, DuPont discovered extremely high PFAS concentrations in groundwater underneath the Dordrecht factory grounds, which appeared to have leaked from damaged pipes [4]. Out of concern over legal and liability consequences, the company covered up its findings rather than taking action against the ""involuntary landfill"".For decades, Chemours/DuPont had been keeping their concerns over the PFAS they had been working with to themselves to avoid financial consequences and reputational damage. In 2015, DuPont split off into Chemours. From that point, Chemours started framing any allegations directed at them as none of their responsibility because the 'independent' company DuPont is accountable, while DuPont pointed its fingers back at Chemours [7]. As such, the chemical giant complicated the blame game, even though they knew they had been withholding crucial information from the public and thereby putting them in danger for decades.A 2015 report by Follow the Money prompted parliamentary interest and a large-scale investigation into the toxics Chemours/DuPont had been releasing into the environment from its Dordrecht facility [8]. In the year that followed, local residents started getting their blood tested, which contained PFAS concentrations many times as high as the norm.In 2017, residents of municipalities surrounding the Dupont plant created Burenraad Dupont Chemours (DuPont Chemours Neighbor Council) to facilitate communications with the company [8]. Cooperation with Chemours/DuPont was suspended in the summer of 2023, however, due to a lack of open dialogue and trust. In 2018, the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport (RIVM) advised against eating vegetables grown in gardens within a kilometer of the Dordrecht facility [8]. Later it also became clear that eggs from poultry near the chemical factory contain dangerously high concentrations of PFAS [1]. Measurements demonstrated that waters in a 15-kilometer radius around the factory are heavily polluted with PFAS [9]. As these substances are discharged into the Merwede River, they flow into other rivers downstream and into the ocean [8]. PFAS are transported by the Gulf Stream and have been observed in Arctic seawater, contaminating marine ecosystems [1].After the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) added GenX to the EU list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in 2019, Chemours contested this decision in the EU's Court of Justice [10]. Throughout the case, the ECHA and the Government of the Netherlands were supported by environmental law charity ClientEarth and CHEM Trust. In 2022, the European Court of Justice rejected Chemours' appeal against the inclusion of GenX in the SVHC, confirming that the ECHA rightfully categorized GenX as a substance of very high concern.In June 2023, a reportage by Zembla revealed the far-reaching environmental and health impacts associated with the PFOA and GenX released by Chemours/DuPont [1]. The documentary report showed that many of Chemours' (former) employees and local residents have been falling ill over the last years. To Chemours, these findings must have not been surprising, considering they had been monitoring employees' health at the Dordrecht plants since the 1980s [4]. As early as 1981, blood tests showed alarming levels of PFAS among employees. 2006 blood test results established that PFOA values among employees of the Dordrecht facility were higher than any of DuPont's other facilities [4]. Shortly after the Zembla reportage appeared, approximately 150 local residents gathered at the entrance of the factory, where they dumped polluted soil from their gardens and emptied bottles of tap water [11]. This was the largest of the weekly protest action group Gezondheid voor Alles (Health First) had been organizing since 2019.The struggle for holding Chemours/DuPont accountable for the health and environmental damages it inflicted is particularly complicated because the substances released by the company were permitted by the government. Because the company failed to notify officials of the severe risks involved with PFAS, for a long time there were no regulations set in place to control the use and release of PFAS. The difficulty of making a case against DuPont is illustrated by the two-decades-lasting legal struggle by lawyer Rob Bilott on behalf of 70,000 Ohio and West Virginia residents against DuPont in Parkersburg in the United States [4].Despite the complexity of the issue, the municipalities of Dordrecht, Sliedrecht, Papendrecht, and Molenlanden filed a liability claim against Chemours and DuPont in February 2018 [5]. They summoned the companies for the consequences of PFOA and GenX emissions, for which DuPont/Chemours previously denied liability. According to the claim, DuPont/Chemours insufficiently warned about the environmental and health risks of PFOA and GenX although they knew of them, and took inadequate action to prevent the dire consequences associated with the use and release of these substances. In September 2023, lawyer Bénédicte Ficq pressed charges against Chemours on behalf of approximately 3,000 affected residents of the Dordrecht region [2]. In the claim, they accuse the company of willingly polluting air, soil, and waters with PFOA and GenX. Many of the participants in the mass claim reported suffering health impacts from PFAS exposure. At least part of the juridical fees is covered by a crowdfunding action under the name 'Stop PFAS, stop Chemours', which raised over 37,000 euros [2]. In September 2023, an independent commission 'Provinciale Adviescommissie Leefomgevingskwaliteit' (PAL) advised the province of South Holland to temporarily shut down the Chemours facility until PFAS emissions are demonstrably down to zero [12].",pfas-pollution-by-chemours-dupont-the-netherlands,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (""DBNPS""), which currently includes Guangdong Nuclear Power Station (""GNPS"") and Lingao Nuclear Power Station (""LNPS""), is located at Daya Bay about 50 km north-east of the Hong Kong city centre.  About 70% of GNPS's electricity output is supplied to Hong Kong. The output of LNPS is entirely supplied to Guangdong Province.[1] According to HKNIC, the electricity produced by Daya Bay saves Hong Kong each year some 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, some ten thousands tonnes of sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, as well as hundreds of tonnes of airborne particulates that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel generation. Some additional 10% is also being imported from late 2014 to 2018 on a temporary basis.[2]According to the Administration, GNPS comprises two French-designed pressurized water reactors which have an excellent safety record worldwide. Each reactor is protected by three barriers to prevent the release of radioactive material from the core. In addition, there are multiple protective systems. In the event of failure of one of the systems, there are multiple means for meeting the safety targets. The design of the pressurized water reactors at LNPS is similar to those at GNPS.[1]The joint venture contract was signed in early 1985 following formal approval from both the Central Government in Beijing and the Hong Kong Government. The negotiation for the Daya Bay nuclear power station project coincided with the political negotiations between China and Britain over the future of Hong Kong – the 1997 issue. (The political negotiations commenced in September 1982 and concluded in late 1984). The Daya Bay project was seen at the time as a symbol of joint cooperation between the Chinese Government (the country's first nuclear power plant) and the British Government (GEC being a key equipment supplier) for the long-term (20-year contract between China Light Power and the Chinese partner) benefit of Hong Kong (secure and reliable power supply to Hong Kong at a relatively stable price).Concerns over the nuclear project were heard during the negotiation phase but were limited to local environmental groups rather than the general public. The focus was more on the environmental and radiological impact of a nuclear power station than specific technical and safety issues. As for the general public, the project wasn't much of an issue ... until April 1986.[3]As ""the most controversial environmental issue in the 1980s""[4], the Anti-Daya Bay Nuclear Plant Campaign developed under the shadow of political uncertainty over Hong Kong's Future and coincided with the drafting process of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR in 1986. The nuclear accident at Chernobyl in April 1986 also helped the mobilization by changing people's views of nuclear energy.At the beginning, there was a debate in the local media on the safety of and need for nuclear energy, and a generalized doubt over the PRC's ability to manage a nuclear facility. The debate then quickly turned into a polarized and antagonistic process of politicization between the pro-Daya Bay camp, consisting of a strong coalition among the pro-PRC-Daya, conservative, and business interests on the one hand, and environmental NGOs, veteran social activists, and environmentally sensitive middle-class liberals on the other. Both camps were supported by their respective media and press institutions. [4]Hong Kong legislators also visited nuclear sites in France, Austria, the United States and Japan in response to mounting disquiet in the island colony since the April 26 Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.[5] After their return, the two separate groups of Hong Kong's Legislative Councillors spent three weeks writing up a 200-page report in which they urged the Chinese authorities to take more stringent safety measures at Daya Bay, and suggested that a joint committee including participants from Hong Kong should monitor the operation of the plant. The report made it clear, however, that it was the Chinese government, not the Hong Kong government, which would take the final decision over construction at Daya Bay. The anti-Daya Bay press became further divided after the release of the report.[6]The Chinese nuclear industry minister, Jiang said in one of his press conferences that, the Daya Bay site was chosen after careful geological study. For more than 1,000 years, he said, the area has had no earthquakes that would have measured 7 or more on the Richter scale. The Daya plant will be able to withstand quakes of 8 or more, he said. Such assurances have failed to quiet the Hong Kong opposition. Political groups, legislators and newspaper publishers continue to question whether the site is safe, whether the technology is fool-proof and whether Hong Kong residents could be evacuated fast enough in case of a disaster. So great has been the furor that nuclear safety issues have become enmeshed with the larger political questions about how much political autonomy and economic prosperity Hong Kong will have under Chinese rule.[7]Under the leadership of a Joint Conference for Shelving the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant formed by 107 local pressure and community groups, the Anti-Daya Bay movement solicited more than one million signatures in a signature campaign. The Joint Conference was an amalgamation of most pressure and community groups developed in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, plus those elected officials eager to try out their mandated role as the people's representative (elections for local level representative bodies, the District Board, and the Regional Councils were first held in 1985 and 1986). Though the million-strong signatures do not suggest active support for the Anti-Daya Bay campaign as the Chinese minister of nuclear industry, Jiang, rejected the petition that ""The Chinese government will treat the matter with a scientific and practical attitude. It will not halt the Daya Bay project because of objections from some people""[8], they do indicate the breadth of the resentment over the project and an acceptance of the movement's articulation of the issue.A peculiar feature of the movement was that the core leaders in the Joint Conference were not strongly associated with established NGOs. Both CA (The Conservation Association) and the FoE (Friends of Earth) were members of the Joint Conference, and the latter's spokesman, Reverend Fund Chi-wood, was a member of CA. Nevertheless, the Anti-Daya Bay movement was steered by other veteran pressure groups, such as the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee, the Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, and elected officials and community organizations. After the campaign, the leader of the anti-nuclear campaign retreated from high-profile environmental protests and turned to other rising, contentious social issues on the political agenda. In the late 1980s, the agenda of popular mobilizations was dominated by the issue of political liberalization. Yet the transient nature of the mobilizations in the Daya Bay case was evident when the protests eventually receded after the movement was counteracted by a corporate public relations campaign (The China Light & Power Co.) [3] and both the British colonial state and socialist Chinese state showed no sign of concession[9]. The Anti-Daya Bay campaign died down rapidly after the Guangdong Nuclear Power Plant Joint Venture Company and the (British and French) suppliers signed contracts for the plant. [4]In 2010, it was reported that there are leaked traces of radioactive iodine into the surrounding cooling fluid, but no radiation escaped the building. The Hong Kong electric utility, CLP, said in a statement that the leak was small and fell below international standards requiring reporting as a safety issue.[10]After the Japanese earthquake which triggered a nuclear disaster in Fukushima, there were anti-nuclear marches around the world. On 12 June 2011, three months after the earthquake, there was a march in Hong Kong as well, with one hundred protesters. They first assembled in Tsim Sha Tsui to mourn the dead, and then marched at three o'clock. When passing by the post office, a representative, on behalf of the alliance Anti-Nuke, posted two letters to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan respectively, asking them to support the abolition of nuclear power and a nuclear-free zone in Asia. They eventually marched to the head office of the China Light and Power which is an equity holder of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The protestors demanded its nuclear power plants be stopped immediately. The representative read out a declaration, demanding that all nuclear power plants be shut down immediately.[11]",daya-bay-nuclear-power-plant-guangdong-china,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"On 20 June 2020, Euronews reported that environmental organisations were taking the Estonian authorities to court over plans to build a new oil shale plant [1]. Fridays for Future Estonia argued the new plant, to be operated by subsidiaries of the state-owned Eesti Energia company, is not compatible with Estonia's obligations under the Paris Agreement. They are being supported by Friends of the Earth (FoE) Europe who also accuse the government of using the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures banning gatherings - and therefore protests - to push through the proposal. Their legal case was accepted by the Tartu administrative court last month, which subsequently rejected their application for an interim injunction to halt construction work. FoE said that the government, which will pour €125 million of public funds into the project, is ""gambling on the failure of international climate agreements, a continued dependence on fossil fuels and the subsidising of the declining oil industry.""In a statement to Euronews, Fridays for Future Estonia argued that the world is currently in ""a climate emergency"" and that ""every action a country takes should be made in accordance with that knowledge, because the actions taken right now have a life-or-death consequence."" ""Construction of the new oil shale plant is in direct opposition to moving towards a sustainable future where our lifestyle does not exceed the Earth's limits,"" it added. It also flagged that ""Estonia is currently on track to miss the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set for 2030 in the national development agendas – a course which is incompatible with Estonia's obligations under the Paris Agreement."" Ninety public figures have also signed an open letter to the government calling for the plant's building permit to be revoked and for public funding to be withdrawn. ""The investment is in direct contravention of the European Union's climate protection strategy, even though Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has publicly promised to invest in mitigating climate change,"" they wrote. ""The construction of the new oil plant violates section five of the constitution, according to which Estonia's natural resources constitute national wealth that needs to be used sparingly. The construction of an oil plant clashes with sustainable development goals and obligations pursuant to the Paris Agreement, inevitably raising the question of why invest in yesterday,"" they added. Shale oil is produced by heating oil shale rock fragments to convert the organic matter within the rock into synthetic oil and gas. It is one of the dirtiest oils because production typically leads to more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than conventional oil extraction. It can also require a huge amount of water to produce and generates a lot more waste material which then needs to be disposed of. Estonia had the second-highest GHG emission per capita in the EU in 2017 after Luxembourg, according to Eurostat. The latest report from the Ministry of the Environment states that emissions of carbon dioxide decreased by nearly 50 per cent between 1990 and 2017. The report also reveals that the energy sector is by far the country's largest producer of GHG emissions, accounting for 88.76 per cent of all emissions in 2017, adding that ""since 2009 the GHG emissions are strongly related to the volume of exported electricity that is mainly produced from oil shale"" [1].In May 2020, various groups complained about Estonian plans to the EU Commission.  ""The Estonian government's decision to invest taxpayers' money in the high-risk sector is unacceptable and contradicts EU goals, particularly with the present great need to use resources for resolving economic bottlenecks caused by COVID-19 and for ensuring a green transition,"" said  Elif Gunduzyeli, senior policy coordinator at Climate Action Network Europe (CAN-E), one of the signatories of the inquiry. The organizations requested an assessment from the European Commission regarding said contradictions as well as inquiring about specific measures the European Commission plans to implement to ensure that Estonia or other member states potentially receiving funds from the JTF will not use states' own resources or mechanisms to support contradicting goals. Signatories to the inquiry include the Estonian Fund for Nature, the Estonian Green Movement, the Estonian Environmental Law Center, CAN-E, CEE Bankwatch Network and numerous other organizations [5].The background is as follows. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia as a substitute for natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again at the beginning of the 21st century. Research on the issues is being done by the Carbon Intensive Regions in Transition project – CINTRAN. ""It is often thought that only the environment and economic impacts should be considered when dealing with climate change issues. However, it is equally important to consider social, cultural, demographic and political factors,"" Annela Anger-Kraavi, a Cambridge University climate scientist, told Estonian World. Indeed, Ida-Viru County borders Russia and 73% of its inhabitants are ethnic Russians.

"This environmental justice conflict is centered around a proposed mixed-use development project in San Francisco's Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood. The project is a public-private partnership proposed by the India Basin Neighborhood Association, SF Recreation and Parks Department, and the local residential developer BUILD [1]. The project will include 1,575 residential units as well as 1,800 parking spaces, 15.5 acres of open space, and 200,000 feet of commercial space. Most of these units will be expensive, especially when compared to the property values of houses in Bayview Hunters Point [2]. San Francisco as a whole is a city growing in attractiveness and seeking to expand its housing options to support the influx of residents from the Silicon Valley tech boom. Many of these new development projects are being built in the southeast part of the city in neighborhoods like Dogpatch and Mission Bay, which were previously underdeveloped [3][4]. The projects are mostly high-end housing, designed to match the higher incomes of the city's new residents [5]. These expensive development projects have led to gentrification problems and contribute to the affordable housing crisis happening across San Francisco [5][6]. Bayview Hunters Points is a community that has historically suffered from severe industrial pollution and environmental injustices. The community is mostly people of color as it is 29.6% Black, 27.2% Hispanic, 26.8% Asian, and only 8.3% White whereas San Francisco as a whole is 5.4% Black and 41.2% White [7]. The median annual household income of Bayview Hunters Point residents is $30,000 less than the rest of San Francisco [8]. Additionally, the unemployment rate in the area near the project is 30.4. The community already struggles economically, and San Francisco has the highest cost of living out of any city in the United States [9]. The poor minority population has been subjected to terrible environmental injustices, such as soil contaminated with radioactive material by the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and the PG&E power plant in the neighborhood, which has contributed to air pollution problems [10]. Currently, the community still suffers from disproportionate levels of health problems. Bayview Hunters Point has already been acknowledged as an impacted community by California's Community Air Risk Evaluation (CARE) program and is a part of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) Community Health Protection Program [2]. Particulate pollution (PM2.5) in eastern San Francisco is higher than the rest of the city and the neighborhood is ranked in the 90-95th percentile for communities most at risk from pollution in California [2][11]. According to the EPA, short term and long term exposure to particulate matter increases the likelihood of premature death for people with heart or lung disease, non-fatal heart attacks, an irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms like irritation, coughing, or difficulty breathing [12]. A 2000 study found that one out of six children and one out of ten adults in the neighborhood suffered from asthma, and that neighborhood residents were significantly more likely to have certain types of cancer [13]. The community also bears the costs of diesel, traffic, hazardous waste, impaired water, and solid waste hazards [11]. This is a community that is already extremely overburdened and cannot afford to bear another injustice in the form of the India Basin Mix-Use Development Project.The primary organization opposing the development of this project is Greenaction. Greenaction is a watchdog environmental justice organization that has been historically active in Bayview Hunters Point and is cooperating with the Bayview Hunters Point Mothers and Fathers Committee to oppose the project [14]. The two have helped organize protests against the project and met with BAAQMD repeatedly to voice their apprehensions about the project. Greenaction also filed an appeal demanding that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors rescind the project's approval based on evidence of the project's harm in San Francisco's Environmental Impact Report [15]. Greenaction still hopes that the site will be remediated to get rid of the contamination in the neighborhood, but they also want to avoid the subsequent development which would result in air pollution and gentrification [2]. While the project has not begun construction as of January 2020, the community has already experienced injustices during the review process for the project. The Planning Department originally violated language access and civil rights laws when they refused to translate important documents and notices about the project for the neighborhood's' non-English speaking residents [16]. Their failure to translate infringed upon minorities' rights to equal participation. The Planning Department later acknowledged and corrected their mistakes. Another injustice occurred on August 17, 2018, when the Planning Department told Greenaction the project could not be appealed [15]. This was a false statement and Greenaction was only informed of the fact that they could appeal the project on August 27, 2018, the same day the appeal was due. Greenaction managed to file the appeal on time, but that false statement was almost able to suppress the project's opposition. BAAQMD also testified at a hearing on October 16, 2018, that the project protected the health of the local residents [2]. In fact, this statement directly contradicted the city's own EIR. Greenaction demanded that BAAQMD revise their testimony and BAAQMD eventually did so in a letter saying ""Any increase in air pollution of the current disproportionate burden in eastern San Francisco is unacceptable. The Air District is concerned about the potential impact of the construction and operation of the Project"" [16]. Even though some of these injustices were later corrected, there has been a clear disregard for the community's health and voice in favor of fast-tracking development. San Francisco's EIR concluded that the project will have additional negative effects on the neighborhood's already poor air quality. The EIR determined exposure to criteria air pollutants and their precursors would ""contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation, or result in a cumulatively considerable net increase in criteria pollutants"" [17]. Pollution from particulate matter would violate the California Environmental Quality Act's (CEQA) standards. This exposure would occur during construction, operations, and any overlapping activities and ""will be significant, harmful"" and unavoidable regardless of any mitigation strategies [17]. Therefore, the only option to truly protect the already overburdened Bayview Hunters Point community from being further subjected to particulate matter pollution and an air quality violation is to not develop India Basin. If the adverse health impacts of the project alone are not enough, California Senate Bill 1000 requires the city of San Francisco to consider environmental justice in its General Plan, which includes air quality issues [16]. Based on this bill, San Francisco should stop development, to protect this overburdened environmental justice community. The EIR concluded that even once the project is completed, there could still be increased air pollution during the day to day operations of the development [18]. This is further cause for concern as the increased air pollution will not be an isolated incident during construction. It will instead permanently add air pollution to a community that is already suffering from adverse health effects from particulate matter. Additionally, gentrification is of utmost concern for local residents. As previously mentioned, most of the housing developed in the project will be expensive and unaffordable for the current residents, whose income is far less than the median in San Francisco [8]. Not only are most residential units intended to be expensive, but even the so-called affordable housing units are still extremely expensive, as they are only 20% below market price [15]. Furthermore, the project will include parks, accessible shoreline, and a view of San Francisco Bay, which will increase the neighborhood's attractiveness, further driving up property values. 91% of residents in the EIR study site rent their homes, and most will not be able to afford to stay if the price of rent increases above what it already is ($3,311 a month average) [19]. Little to none of this development will go towards benefitting the community, which is one of the claims used to justify the project [18]. Instead, long-time residents of Bayview Hunters Point will have to endure the pollution during construction before being displaced upon the completion of the project. The Planning Commission claimed that the benefits of the project, open space and ""affordable housing"" override the drawbacks of the project such as violations of air quality standards [18]. The Planning Commission did this to exploit a loophole in CEQA and allow the completion of the project [16]. The argument that open space and so-called affordable housing are more important than clean air for Bayview Hunters Point residents is a textbook environmental injustice. Proponents of the project have attempted to stifle their opposition in favor of upscale development, and it seems as if they will be successful. Currently, the prospects of stopping the project seem bleak, but it is not for lack of effort from opponents of the project. Greenaction has organized protests against the project along with other groups such as the Bayview Hunters Point Mothers and Fathers Committee [2]. Most of the activism, however, has come during meetings with BAAQMD to discuss the needs of the people [2]. Many local residents also expressed their objections to the project during the public comment phase of the proposal. However, despite all of the negative impacts on community health, the impending gentrification, and the community's objections, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to uphold the project ten to one [3]. Instead of listening to the community and remediating the area without developing it, the India Basin Mix Used development project will likely be built. This will contribute to San Francisco's ongoing affordable housing and gentrification crisis, as low-income residents will continue to be displaced in favor of new development projects [2]. The project will add another entry to the long list of environmental injustices that the Bayview Hunters Point community has been forced to endure.",india-basin-mixed-use-development-project-in-bayview-hunters-point,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The wind energy project that has been developed since 2001 in the department of La Guajira emerged as an alternative to obtaining energy through clean mechanisms, but its implementation and development has had significant consequences for the indigenous communities inhabiting the territory. The Jepirachi wind farm is located in the area of Puerto Bolívar and Cabo de la Vela, near the municipality of Uribía, the indigenous capital of Colombia, within the indigenous Wayuu territory. The area is arid, sparsely populated, and underdeveloped, where communities have learned to live within the parameters allowed by nature. Paradoxically, it is an area with abundant fossil fuel resources; La Guajira possesses the majority of Colombia's coal fields. Empresas Públicas de Medellín EPM has been the driving force behind this initiative, along with the corresponding local and national authorities. In order to maintain and optimize its operations, EPM has enlisted the help of Industries Ectricol. Jepirachi, which means northeast winds (winds coming from the northeast towards Cabo de la Vela) in Wayuunaiki, the native language of the Wayuu, is the first wind energy generating park built in the country. Jepirachi is a research project for clean and renewable energy, aiming to develop a new energy supply alternative for the country. It has a capacity of 19.5 MW of installed nominal power, with 15 wind turbines of 1.3 MW each, subject to the trade winds that blow almost year-round in this part of the peninsula at an average speed of 8 meters per second. The machines are distributed in two rows of eight and seven respectively, covering an area approximately one kilometer long parallel to the beach, and 1.2 kilometers wide to the north of the Kasiwolin settlement and to the west of the Arutkajui settlement. The park began full commercial operation on April 19, 2004, and is part of a larger program for the utilization of wind energy in the Upper Guajira. Jepírachi is registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It was one of the first CDM projects signed in the country and one of the first in the world, representing an important milestone in the history of the carbon market. The estimation methodologies for emissions and, above all, the project's negotiation with the Wayuu community were considered exemplary by the World Bank and as mandatory references for the development of similar projects in other parts of the world. Its social management is based on respecting the ethnic and cultural integrity of the Wayuu community, establishing trusting relationships, and seeking equity and mutual benefit. However, this beautiful panorama began to lose its luster, as an expedition of at least 45 individuals seeking to recognize the social and environmental issues in La Guajira determined the following: The Jepirachi wind farm, which was envisioned as a more sustainable energy project to serve the population, does not provide opportunities for the residents of the Arutkajui and Kasiwolin communities. The people make it known that while Empresas Públicas de Medellín - EPM - turn the wind into profit through emissions trading, they do not receive any watt of this energy. However, they show us the advertisements that EPM uses to sell supposed social benefits and contributions to the communities. The Wayuu feel deceived by the company, while they live in the midst of a project that has drastically transformed their landscape. The energy potential of this region is considerable; however, the Guajira people are increasingly impoverished, and their culture is more threatened than it was decades ago when several of these projects began. The territory is being drained every day of matter and energy; coal and gas are being depleted, productive soils are disappearing with the rains, jobs are vanishing, clean water is running out, rivers are losing their water, and people are left without work, resources, or water. It seems that even the good vallenato music is coming to an end. Only landfills, mud, packaging, and plastic bags that flood the sea and the streets remain, as well as malnourished boys and girls rummaging through the garbage. People pay sums that consume their meager income to obtain poor public services. The energy they receive is of low quality and is intermittently suspended; the water is polluted, and the garbage overwhelms them. A small transnational group reaps the benefits, and some of the wealthy and politicians thrive around them. Currently, this region reflects the absence of productive linkages related to wind energy; there are no industries, commerce, or transportation sectors. Regarding the social indicators of the department, the influence of this significant project is mediated by aspects that favor ""others"" and not the communities. Ultimately, the standard of living in La Guajira is the fourth lowest in the country.",parque-eolico-jepirachi-colombia,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"""AquAdvantage salmon"" is a genetically modified (GM) Atlantic salmon developed by AquaBounty Technologies. It grows much faster than its farmed non-GE or wild counterparts by containing a gene encoding Chinook salmon growth hormone under the control of an antifreeze protein promoter and terminator from ocean pout [11, 12]. The debates regarding its approval as a species that can be commercialized — it has been dubbed Frankenfish by its opponents — began in September 2011 with a meeting of the Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) as well as a public hearing, together with the release of a health and safety briefing and an environmental assessment package on the transgenic animal developed by AquaBounty Technologies of Waltham, Massachusetts. Despite VMAC's determination that AquAdvantage salmon is ""as safe as food from conventional Atlantic salmon,"" critics continue to raise concerns relating to its allergenicity, levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as the potential impacts of the farmed GMO fish on the environment. This development has resulted in various concerns and debates about its safety, health and environmental impacts both in US and Canada, including the regulatory regimes in both countries and their markets [11]. ""Unlike transgenic plants, GE food animals are regulated as drugs in the United States, and as such they must go through the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new animal drug approval process. This means that developers must show their product to be safe and effective as well as provide an assessment of its environmental impacts, under the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). When AquaBounty Technologies (then A/F Protein) initiated discussions with the FDA seeking regulatory guidance for development and approval of AquAdvantage salmon in 1993, no defined regulatory pathway existed for GE animals. Under the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, a 1986 policy that called for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FDA to regulate GE products using existing laws, USDA was the lead agency to regulate GE plants, but no regulatory path had been clearly set out for GE animals. Thus, the company petitioned for regulation under FDA"" [11].Nevertheless, ""during the winter of 2012–2013, anticipation of the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the AquAdvantage Salmon as the first genetically modified animal for human consumption generated much discussion. Proponents were excited about this invention, suggesting that genetically modified salmon provides economic and ecological benefits through the application of new technologies and market mechanisms"" [12]; while opponents were not convinced by these ideas and strongly argued against its approval. After receiving the news of the Canadian Government's approval of GM salmon in November 2013, Nova Scotia's Ecology Action Centre and British Columbia's Living Oceans Society have taken the Canadian government to court to challenge its decision to allow AquaBounty Technologies Inc. to manufacture genetically modified (GM) salmon eggs at Bay Fortune, Prince Edward Islands. They argued that the federal government violated its own laws in issuing that approval and managed to halt the project due to the legal action. Both organisations promote healthy local food, protecting wild salmon, demanding openness and transparency in government decision-making, ensuring thorough risk assessments [1].In 2016, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada approved the rearing of genetically modified salmon [4]. Ecojustice lawyers representing environmental groups such as Ecology Action Centre and Living Oceans Society claimed that the approval for this genetically modified species is unlawful because it failed to assess whether genetically modified salmon could become invasive, potentially putting ecosystems and species such as wild salmon at risk. Both groups were asking the court to set aside the government's assessment and require the government to comply with the law before permitting the manufacture of these genetically modified organisms [5].AquaBounty's plan was to grow the genetically modified salmon eggs in Prince Edward Islands, Canada; then to transport them to Panama, where they would grow to market size in salmon farms before sending them to US and Canada markets. However, the approval would also allow the manufacture and growth of the genetically modified salmon elsewhere in Canada under certain conditions [5].According to Living Oceans Society, another worrying aspect of this case is the lack of transparency and public consultation in the decision-making process even though this is the world's first genetically modified food animal for direct human consumption. They asserted that this was done without any public debate at all and under circumstances that look like a deliberate attempt to prevent public comment [5].",genetically-modified-salmon-for-direct-human-consumption,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"Anglesea is a beachside town in Victoria with a population of around 2,500 people on the Great Ocean Road - one of Australia's primary tourist destinations. Brown coal has been mined in Anglesea since 1959, and the Anglesea Power Station was established in 1969 to provide electricity to Alcoa's Point Henry aluminium smelter (Su and Jones 2017). The open cut coal mine is 325 hectares on Crown land in a unique and biodiverse heathland and connects to the Anglesea Power Station by a three kilometre private road (Su and Jones 2017). The Anglesea Power Station employed around 85 people in 2015 (Arup and Willington 2015), had a capacity of 150 megawatts of electricity and supplied around 40% of Point Henry aluminium smelter's energy (Su and Jones 2017). The power station is one kilometre from the boundary of Anglesea and the road from the coal mine is just 500 metres. Using brown coal, and with aging infrastructure, the power station was one of the most polluting in Australia. Health impacts from pollution from coal mining operations are well understood around the world and include heart disease, lung disease and cancer, and the Anglesea Power Station had extremely high sulphur content as explained by Doctors for Environment Australia: ""When it is burned at Anglesea Power Station, high levels of sulphur dioxide are emitted. Sulphur dioxide is a respiratory irritant with no safe exposure level of exposure. It can trigger asthma attacks and worsen lung diseases like emphysema"" - Dr Eugenie Kayak, Victorian Chair of Doctors for the Environment Australia (Doctors for Environment Australia 2014). Members of the local community had many concerns about the mine and power station. People were concerned about the health impacts, particularly on vulnerable people including children and the elderly; inadequate assessments of the impacts of pollution on human health and particularly a new school that was built in 2011 only one kilometre from the mine; inadequate pollution standards in the National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM); inadequate communication from Alcoa to the community and dismissal of community concerns; the powerlessness of the community to speak out against a company that is a major employer and sponsor of the local school and community organisations; the potential expansion of the mine into the Anglesea Heath; and the contribution of the coal fired power station to climate change (Surf Coast Air Action 2013). In December 2013, Alcoa applied to the Essential Services Commission for an independent electricity generators licence, so it could generate electricity and sell it directly to the market (Vorrath 2014). In February 2014, Alcoa announced that the Point Henry aluminium smelter, which was established in 1963, would close later that year. Alcoa also announced that the Anglesea Power Station was on the market, and it would either be sold or closed by the end of 2014. Members of the community, including local ENGO Surf Coast Air Action (SCAA) and Doctors for the Environment were advocating for the closure of the mine and power station. SCAA's purpose is to ""stop the damage to our air, health and environment caused by coal mining and combustion on the Surf Coast through advocacy and education"" (Surf Coast Air Action). In their submission to the Essential Services Commission, SCAA stated that ""local and international scientific and medical evidence shows that Alcoa's Anglesea operations emit SO2 and particulates at levels that are harmful to health"" and that Alcoa wasn't prepared to invest in technology to reduce pollution as it wasn't economically viable to do so (Surf Coast Air Action 2013). Security of energy supply is a major debate in Australia, and was used in support of the Alcoa power station, however SCAA's submission pointed out that Victoria produces a surplus of energy and has immense potential for renewable energy. Actions to close the mine included public forums, community meetings, rallies, social media, letters to newspapers, submissions to inquiries, petitions, surveys, letters and visits to Members of Parliament and letters to potential buyers of the power station demonstrating that the power station had lost its social license. Unable to find a buyer, and under intense economic and social pressure, Alcoa decided to cease operation of the mine and power station from 31 August 2015 and the anticipated closure of the mine is 1961.",alcoa-coal-closes-in-anglesea,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
"The company Cemex Dominicana is making a strong lobby in the government to install a cement plant in the buffer zone of Los Haitises National Park. Mobilizations from various sectors of the country have not been delayed: young people have set up a camp in the area in rejection of the initiative, trade unions have publicly declared their opposition, as well as the scientific and environmentalist world. The court ruled against the company and suspended the installation of the cement plant. However, Dominicans fear that it will be ignored, just like the official report prepared by the Sub-Secretary of State for Protected Areas, which clearly stated that the construction project of the cement plant ""is not viable in environmental terms, and therefore it is suggested that it be dismissed"", despite being approved by the government, so the judicial ruling that was issued in 2009 was cautiously expected. The industrial project endangers the groundwater reserves of the karstic formation of Los Haitises, waters that are essential for the future supply of Santo Domingo and the entire eastern region of the country, particularly the community of the District of Gonzalo. Cemex already has a notorious history for its operations in the port of Barahona, previously a tourist area and now is almost a cemetery due to environmental malpractices.

"In the First Section of the Islands of the Paraná Delta, in the municipality of Tigre, between the Anguila Stream, Vinculación Canal, and the San Antonio River, in 2008 a conflict between island families, different local social-environmental organizations, and a mega real estate development of gated community (GC) ""ColonyPark SA"" became public. Both these island families and the members of the environmental organizations residing on the islands, given their unique way of life, highly linked to the river, the wetland, and their dynamics, can be considered a traditional island community. The families of the Anguila Stream have been living on the islands since the beginning of their alluvial formation, engaging in reed collection for local market sale, seasonal fishing and hunting, small-scale forestry, and subsistence production. Due to their vital activities, some would go fishing upstream, to the doctor or to the continent during the schooling period of their children, and upon their return, neither their homes nor the stream were there. ""Colony Park SA"" proposed to create a luxury GC of almost 300 lots for permanent or semi-permanent housing for high-income sectors. The works began at the end of 2007, on one hand, dredging, straightening, and widening the course of the stream, clearing and filling in part of the hectares; on the other hand, violently evicting some families, and offering others to sign an ""Eviction Agreement"" that was not legally valid. The undertaking argued to have the legal ownership of the lands, project feasibility approval, and a permit to dredge the rivers. Due to the situation of violence and ecosystem transformation, several families left out of fear, and few remained resisting. They organized themselves under the Río de la Plata International Basin Assembly (ARPCI) with a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against the enterprise for environmental damage and harm to the island community. Shortly after, some of these families organized for territorial resistance in the Isla Esperanza Cooperative, and met with national organizations such as the National Peasant Indigenous Movement (MNCI), local organizations with a long history such as the Delta and Río de la Plata Assembly (ADRP); Casa Puente, a cultural and community center; and international organizations such as Friends of the Earth Argentina, among others. ADRP had been denouncing this and other real estate developments, so the encounter with organized families increased the presence of the conflict in the public space and governmental pressure. After three years of conflict, the social and environmental organizations and the island families managed to halt the works due to the environmental damages caused and the alteration of the local way of life. The ownership of the lands by the families has not been recognized, the criminal litigation awaits judicial resolution, and conflict situations have been recorded up to the present day. In 2012, in the criminal case against ""Colony Park,"" public officials and businessmen were held responsible for environmental damages and were ordered to pay a fine. In 2016, they were acquitted and have not paid the fines. That same year, the work shed of the Isla Esperanza Cooperative was burned down, following a series of harassment that they had been experiencing during those years. Since then, several families have returned to the territory to strengthen the fight for the land and the island way of life, creating the ""Island Community Reserve"" as a defense of the territory; at the same time, other organizations such as the Delta Wetlands Observatory have been created.",emprendimientos-urbanos-colony-park-arroyo-anguila-la-paloma-argentina,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Since the 1800s, the Miccosukee Tribe has lived in the Florida Everglades - first seeking refuge from colonizing forces, but in the process, forming a deep connection with the land and water of the area [1]. Today, the cultural traditions of the tribe remain connected to the health of the Everglades ecosystem. However, Miccosukee lands now face pollution from agriculture, urban development, and industrialism, with specific concerns about water pollution [1; 2]. The Miccosukee people continue to fight forces that seek to threaten their cultural practices, through protest but also judicial activism to battle lax water quality standards. Throughout the last three decades, the Miccosukee Tribe has fought for environmental justice by preventing co-optation of their land and water rights and protesting the maldistribution of polluted water into their community.There are two main areas of concern, the land in the Miccosukee Tribe's Federal Indian Reservation (lands held in trust by the federal government), and lands provided to the Tribe under a perpetual lease from the State of Florida, also known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). When the Miccosukee Tribe was recognized by the federal government decades ago, they were given a total of 90,000 acres of land [3]. The WCA-3A lands were leased to the Tribe in perpetuity in 1982 with the goal to preserve the local ecosystem to protect the Tribe's cultural rights [1]. Although this land is not an Indian Reservation, the agreement states that the area is leased to the tribe as if it were an Indian Reservation [1]. Put together, the tribe has control of over 270,818 acres [1]. Much of Miccosukee Tribal land is located in the Everglades – a large network of ecosystems where the natural flow of water has now been disrupted. Instead of one flowing ecosystem, the Everglades is now more of a network of compartmentalized reservoirs and canals – the result of large scale engineering projects. The Miccosukee Tribe relies on the integrity of the Everglades ecosystem to support their religion, culture and economic prosperity.  In the early 2000s, the South Florida Water Management District began back-pumping polluted water into the greater Everglades ecosystem. The water was pumped from an affluent housing development, urban areas and agricultural lands into tribal waters [4;8]. A prime example of environmental injustice – dumping polluted water into an area for the benefit of others, at the expense of a historically marginalized community. The polluted water began to cause eutrophication and overgrowth of cattails, forcing out native grasses and vegetation [5]. Because of the harm the water pollution is causing towards the ecosystem, the hunting and fishing rights granted to the Miccosukee Tribe is also in jeopardy. This case of water pollution is not only hurting the ecosystem, but also the cultural identity of the Miccosukee Tribe. In the Clean Water Act - legislation designed to protect the waters of the United States [9] - federally recognized tribes have ""treatment as states"" status. This allows the Miccosukee Tribe to set its own water quality standards for tribal waters, which must be adhered to by both members and non-members of the tribe. The South Florida Water Management District's decision to back-pump water into Miccosukee Tribal waters not only violates their water quality standards, but also ignores their authority. Additionally, the Clean Water Act requires that a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit be required before any pollutants from a point source can be discharged into navigable waters [2][5]. The Miccosukee Tribe sued the South Florida Water Management District, stating that an NPDES permit should be required. Through this judicial activism, the Miccosukee Tribe were able to prevent additional water pollution. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Miccosukee Tribe, stating that the water management district needed to acquire a NPDES permit [2].More than a decade later, in 2020, the Miccosukee Tribe faces another challenge to their tribal rights to a clean, Everglades ecosystem. The tribe has an agreement with the federal government, and did not ever consent to state control of wetlands. However, the control of wetlands development was changed from the federal government to the state of Florida when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler gave the Florida Department of Environmental Protection control of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act [3]. This action was part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to weaken environmental protections before Joe Biden's administration came into office. As a result, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is in charge of dredge and fill permits for the Everglades, a change made without any consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe, who have ""treatment as state"" status in the Clean Water Act. In response, the Miccosukee Tribe released a statement: ""The tribe is deeply appalled about the loss of culturally sensitive sites and the potential destruction of the Miccosukee way of life. This way of life is integrally entwined within the Florida Everglades"" [3]. Betty Osceola, a Miccosukee activist, clarified that the ""tribes have codified rights to these lands"" [6]. The Miccosukee Tribe have led several prayer walks, as well as an 80 mile march in the Everglades to raise awareness on this issue. The change in wetlands management, which ignores tribal control of water quality, has taken authority away from the Miccosukee Tribe by acting as if Indian territory only exists in reservation boundaries. This change is especially concerning because of the lack of funding in the Department of Environmental Protection in Florida, meaning permits could be processed and approved without proper scrutiny. 2021 brought yet another threat to the Miccosukee Tribe's tribal rights to a healthy ecosystem when an oil company applied for a permit to drill in Big Cypress National Preserve, where the Miccosukee Tribe has rights to some of the land within the boundaries of the preserve. The Texas based Burnett Oil Co. filed for permits to begin drilling in the preserve in 2022 [7]. If the drilling is allowed to occur, it will not only threaten endangered wildlife, but an ancestral burying ground for the Miccosukee. The Miccosukee Tribe is worried about history, water quality, wildlife and the area's ecosystem. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection, with its limited funding and staffing, is currently reviewing Burnett Oil's application.",fighting-to-protect-miccosukee-tribal-rights-in-the-everglades-florida,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"A massive blast occurred at a paraxylene plant in Zhangzhou City in China's Fujian Province in the evening hours on April 6, 2015. Some 29,096 people were evacuated due to chemical plant fire. Firefighters extinguished fire at the chemical plant on the Gulei Peninsula in Zhangzhou, southeast China's Fujian Province apparently on April 8, 2015, leaving 14 injured, almost two years after a similar accident at the plant had prompted a local official to promise in 2013 that it would never happen again[1]. An emergency headquarter has been set up after the explosion including environmental, maritime and meteorological experts to monitor readings of poisonous gas, toxic chemicals and industrial sewage. ""No significant harm to the natural environment due to the explosion has been detected so far"", according to a Xinhua report. Qin Tianbao, an environmental protection expert at Wuhan University, said that even though paraxylene has low toxicity, building such plants should be strictly regulated after an environmental assessment and public review[2]. However, it was reported that many seahorses died after the explosion[3]. The Zhangzhou PX project was originally to be located in Xiamen but the site of the plant was moved to Zhangzhou in 2008 after Xiamen residents protested the 10.8 billion yuan development on environmental grounds in 2007[4]. The Xiamen protestors gained a complete victory, however, vehement protests in new location failed to stop the project. In 2008 the Fujian provincial government opted to relocate the Xiamen project to Gulei. To avoid upsetting the public there was no mention of 'PX' and the government referred to it as the 'Gulei Major Chemical Project'. According to media reports, the Zhangzhou city government did everything in its power to find a home for the unpopular project, calling upon other local officials, the courts, and even the Communist Party's disciplinary committee, to ensure the plans went ahead[5].   On February 29, 2008, before the two sessions of NPC & CPPCC, thousands of Dongshan people who are living in the neighboring area of Gulei went to streets to protest the relocation of the PX project rejected by Xiamen to Gulei peninsula, expressing their concern about the environmental impacts of the project. Several police vehicles were smashed, one protester died and several injured during the conflict[6].   January 2009, after the initial EIA of the project was issued by MEP, the plant was sited in the Gulei Economic Development Zone, which is located on a natural deep-water harbor about 100 kilometers south of Xiamen. Other petrochemical projects, including a 100-billion yuan petrochemical complex, a 38-billion-yuan ethylene cracker and a $950-million oil storage site, are also being developed in the industrial zone.   In June, 2012, local peasants and fishermen started to protest again on the injustice in land expropriation and unfair compensation for their land and their losing of livelihoods[7]. There are many land conflicts related the PX project, complains about the unfair compensations was reported through different online platforms. In January 2013, construction at the Zhangzhou plant was halted and the Xianglu Tenglong Group (翔鹭腾龙集团), the company developing the plant, was fined 200,000 yuan by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP). The major investor in the project, Dragon Aromatics (Zhangzhou) Co., Ltd (腾龙芳烃(漳州)有限公司), a subsidary of Taiwan's Xianglu Tenglong Group, put in an application to alter the raw materials used in the plant. However, work on this section of the plant began before final approval had been given[8].   Another subsidiary of the group, Xianglu Petrochemicals (翔鹭石化), has also run into problems at it purified terephthalic acid (PTA) plant in Xiamen. Residents who live close to the plant frequently complain about a disturbing smell from the factory. The plant was reported to have been fined by the MEP when it first began production, but little has changed[9].    The first explosion ripped through this paraxylene (PX) plant in Zhangzhou on July 30, 2013. The 4.30am explosion occurred after hydrogen leaked from a pipeline's welding seam during a pressure test at the plant[10].   On June 29, 2014, authorities in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian are holding nearly 30 people following clashes with angry local residents who blockaded a chemical plant accused of causing severe pollution near Zhangzhou city. The clashes came after riot police moved in to disperse thousands of residents of Xingzai village near Zhangzhou's Gulei township, who had been sitting in outside the paraxylene (PX) plant for several days. Photos of the scene posted online showed rows of riot police with shields, batons, and helmets facing off with a crowd of local people. Several thousand local residents began the sit-in, preventing the Gulei PX plant from operating normally, several days ago in protest at the pollution, saying it is compromising their health and that of their families.   After the second explosion, Dragon Aromatics (Zhangzhou) Co., Ltd took a second EIA for their production capacity change[11].

"The James Bay Hydro Project (JBHP) is a massive damming project first proposed in 1971 by the Premier of Quebec Robert Bourassa [1]. The project is the largest power generating site in North America and is on the scale of other well known dam mega-projects such as the Three Gorges Dam in China [1, 2]. Located in the North-West of Quebec, in the Eeyou Istchee, also known as the James Bay area, the JBHP has at times resulted in negotiations with, while at others sparked resistance from, the Eeyou/Eenou (James Bay Cree) and Inuit peoples of the area [1, 3]. While the diversion of water flows entailed that some villages would be impacted or even entirely flooded, unexpected consequences have also incurred from the mega-project in the form of mercury pollution produced by rotting vegetation in the reservoirs [1]. The original project comprised two phases of development. However, only the initial phase was eventually built. The first and second phases, respectively named 'La Grande' (the big one) and 'La Grande Baleine' (the big whale), impacted the Inuit and the Cree differently, and thus incurred distinct forms and degrees of resistance from these two communities [2, 4, 5]. In the case of La Grande Baleine, the extent and diversity of tactics employed by the Cree was successful in indefinitely halting the development of the project in 1994 [4].  In 1970s Canada, social and environmental impacts of large-scale projects were not taken into consideration [4]. Thus when the first phase of the project was originally announced, the Indigenous communities of the affected lands had not been informed or consulted [1]. In fact construction of the project began as soon as 1971 and by 1973, the first dam had been built [6]. The Cree people of Eeyou Istchee were weary of the effects of large scale water diversions on their lands and their hunting, fishing and trapping practices [7]. The Inuit people of Nunavik, who would be less directly impacted by the first phase of the JBHP, were also concerned about the impacts of and compensations for the project [2]. In 1973, both the Cree and the Inuit filed a lawsuit against La Grande, which first yielded a court injunction that paused the project, but was quickly overturned [2, 8]. Thus, while the court case marked a victory for the recognition of indigenous rights, it nonetheless proved ineffective in entirely stopping the project [3, 9]. As a result of this, in 1974, the Cree community established the Grand Council of the Cree (of Quebec) as a governing body to negotiate with the governments of Quebec and Canada [3, 9]. Hydro-Quebec and the government of Quebec entered into negotiations with the Cree and Inuit and the James Bay North Quebec Agreement (JBNQA) was signed in 1975 [3, 8]. The signatories included the Grand Council of the Cree (of Quebec), the Northern Quebec Inuit Association, the provincial government of Quebec, the federal government of Canada, and Hydro-Quebec [2]. The JBNQA represented Canada's first ""modern, comprehensive claims settlement between indigenous peoples and federal and provincial authorities"" [4: 6]. Under the JBNQA, the Cree and Inuit would receive CAD$225 million over two decades and special hunting and fishing rights in exchange for surrendering their lands to the development of the JBHP [1]. Yet, as construction had started before negotiations had even taken place, from the perspective of the Cree, the JBNQA was ""signed under duress"" [6: 93]. The choice to sign or not was artificial because they did not have the option or power to oppose the project and entirely safeguard their lands and practices from its construction. Moreover, while the Inuit also signed the agreement, they were more vocally reluctant as they would receive less benefits for the La Grande phase of development [5].  La Grande has had several environmental and social impacts, some expected and some unforeseen. In 1980, the village of Chisasibi (then called Fort George), with a population of over 2000 inhabitants, and which was in the intended flooding area, was relocated upstream [1]. It was, moreover, discovered that plants and vegetation in the newly flooded reservoirs had rotted from their submersion in water and produced methylmercury as part of their decomposition process, contaminating both the water and fish for human consumption [1]. While there has been a longstanding debate about the extent and impacts of mercury contamination from the La Grande reservoir on human health, the knowledge and fear of contamination have had a heavy economic and sociocultural price [10]. Indeed, as the contamination was discovered and studied, recommendations from the government and local authorities directed people to significantly reduce and regulate their fish intake [10]. Fish constituted a free, healthy and nutritious cornerstone to the Cree diet. Replacing this food source has thus been difficult and community health has suffered from eating increasing amounts of expensive, processed and imported foods [10]. Being unable to trust fish consumption has moreover led to a loss of livelihood for several community members and, furthermore, an unwillful reconversion to other forms of subsistence, a process also accompanied by psychological distress [10]. Mercury contamination has also impacted community access to safe and clean water sources.  The project incurred additional cultural shifts in Cree relations to land and water, by transforming the hydrological landscape from ""well-known landscapes of everyday life"" into an untrustworthy and ""unpredictable force"" [7: 111]. Moreover, the location of one of the reservoirs coincided with ancestral burial sites and while a commemorative plaque was erected, no efforts were made on the part of Hydro-Quebec or the Quebec Government to retrieve and move the remains before the reservoir's filling, causing additional grief within the Cree community [7].  While the construction of the La Grande phase of the project could not be halted, the JBNQA nonetheless provided for the formation of political structures within the Cree of Eeyou Istchee and the Inuit of Nunavik, including several administrative and governing entities, which proved useful in the organization of resistance against the second phase of the project [4]. In the late 80s, the re-elected Bourassa announced the development of the second phase of the JBHP: La Grande Baleine [7]. While Environmental Impact Assessments emerged as policy practice in the 80s, the project was subjected to additional regulation, which slowed the construction process [4]. Moreover, dissatisfied with the way the terms of the JBNQA had been implemented by the Quebec government, the Cree initiated a large and organized resistance strategy against La Grande Baleine. Cree opposition to the JBHP was not premised on an anti-developmentalist stance [7]. Rather, the Cree wanted to establish that their autonomy, environment and cultural continuity needed to be acknowledged, respected and accounted for in the decision-making process [7]. Their resistance strategy included court battles and extensive lobbying, specifically in the northeast of the US, where some of the electricity would be sold [1, 2], as well as forging alliances with international ENGOs including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth [2, 7]. The Cree were particularly worried about the intended flooded areas of La Grande Baleine, which included additional ancestral burial sites as well as their best harvesting land [5]. As a result of these efforts and through losing a significant proportion of its market base, La Grande Baleine was indefinitely shelved in 1994 [1]. For their part, while the Inuit would have been most affected by La Grande Baleine, they had signed distinct benefits agreements with Hydro-Quebec [2]. They were thus more supportive of the second phase of the project, though the intended benefits never materialized as the project was shelved [2]. As another distinct yet connected hydro-electric dam project called the Eastmain 1-A/Rupert project was forming on the horizon, the Cree and Inuit entered into new negotiations with Quebec Premier Bernard Landry [7]. In February 2002, this process yielded the Paix des Braves Agreement (the peace or peace-making of the brave) in 2002 [1]. This agreement was signed on a 'nation-to-nation' basis and provided for increased participation of indigenous communities in matters of mining, forestry and hydroelectric development [3]. Several agreements, signed in turn with Hydro-Quebec, the government of Quebec and the government of Canada, followed the Paix des Braves, as well as several bills [3]. In 2017, the Cree Governance Agreement, in conjunction with the Cree Constitution, established the foundation for the Cree Nation, which soon proposed and passed its own bills, consolidating Cree political authority within Quebec and Canada [3]. The Cree Nation Government's first bill, passed in 2019, protects, promotes and supports the Cree language [3]. The Cree's resistance to the James Bay Hydro Project has thus catalyzed the establishment of a governance structure that consolidates Cree sovereignty over their lands.  For many Quebecois, the significance of the James Bay project extends beyond its function as an energy generator and has been a symbol of Quebec's economic development and independence by means of abundant energy supply [4]. It has thus been the locus of political identity formation in relation to natural resources for both indigenous and settler communities [7]. The project has also been instrumental in shaping Quebec-Canada relations as well as trans-boundary relations with the US through intentions for electricity to be sold to the northeast of the US in Vermont, Maine, New York and New Hampshire [4].",james-bay-hydro-project-quebec-canada,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO

"In 2006 there were proposals for at least two aluminum smelters in Trinidad and Tobago. Alutrint is a joint project between the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the Venezuelan company Sural. The Government, through the National Energy Corporation, holds a 60% stake, while Sural owns the remaining 40%. They stated that the project is expected to last around 20 to 30 years, saying, ""We expect that in the same period of time, global aluminum consumption will double as it has doubled in the last twenty-five years."" By 2030, approximately 55% of the world's aluminum will be consumed in Asia and 35% in China. Therefore, in relative terms, the markets for Trinidad and Tobago will be in North America and the European Union, accounting for just over a quarter of global consumption, although absolute consumption in these areas will continue to grow. Around 125,000 metric tons of the production from this Alutrint plant in La Brea will be processed into bars, ingots, etc. for further use in the manufacturing of aluminum wire, cables, sheets, and other products. Another smelting project was proposed by Alcoa and was expected to be located in a new industrial area in Chatham, Cap-de-Ville, on the southwest peninsula. This plant was anticipated to produce around 341,000 tons of aluminum ingots annually, occupying approximately 182 hectares, including an 80-hectare buffer zone. Several concerns have been raised by members of the community about these smelters, particularly regarding environmental issues and the economic benefits for the country. The project aimed to combine the available energy in Trinidad and Tobago (natural gas) with bauxite from Jamaica, Guyana, and Suriname to produce aluminum. These concerns have sparked public interest in this debate. However, a study published in a local newspaper revealed that about 50% of respondents did not feel there was sufficient information to form an opinion on the development of the aluminum industry in Trinidad and Tobago. Furthermore, there was strong opposition from both the residents of La Brea and civic groups who questioned the project's economy and pollution. Global aluminum consumption in 2005 was around 34 million tons per year, roughly double that of copper, about four times more than zinc, and twenty times more than nickel, making it the largest non-ferrous metal by volume. In terms of value, it is worth just over US$80 billion annually in the primary production stage, slightly less than copper in value. If the two projects in Trinidad and Tobago were to be carried out, they would represent only about one percent of global production and would have an annual value of around US$900 million at the current price. The reason for choosing Trinidad and Tobago was that the aluminum industry requires a strong energy sector, consuming around 15,000 kilowatt-hours to produce one ton of aluminum, much more than any other metal. Smelters are built wherever low energy costs can be found, meaning energy-rich countries like Trinidad and Tobago. However, these arguments did not convince the population, which led to the projects being scrapped.

"Tempa Rossa is an oil field located in the Sauro Valley, in Basilicata, which mainly involves the territory of the municipalities of Corleto Perticara, in the province of Potenza, and Gorgoglione, in the province of Matera [1]. The field was discovered in 1989, within the scope of the mining concession now called ""Gorgoglione"", by Fina, a Belgian company later acquired by Total, which in turn in 2002 obtained the transfer of a 25% stake in the ""Gorgoglione"" concession from Eni [2]. In 1999, three previously existing concessions, ""Gorgoglione"", ""Corleto Perticara"" and ""Tempa d'Emma"", were unified under the name of the ""Gorgoglione"" concession. The exploitation of this concession required the implementation of the development plan of the Tempa Rossa field, which was part of the strategic infrastructure and productive settlement program of national interest established by the CIPE in 2001 with Resolution 121 of December 21 [2][3]. Approximately 25 years have passed from the discovery of the field to the start of the work. In particular, on a national level, in December 2007, the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) approved the preliminary project of the intervention. Once the environmental authorizations for the project were obtained, with a subsequent resolution of March 2012, the CIPE approved the final project [2]. At the regional level, a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2004 through the Regional Executive Resolution 2618 [4]. In particular, it was specified that Total had to set up an environmental monitoring network for which it had to pay the Region 3 million euros in addition to 1.5 million euros per year for twenty years for the management of the monitoring system [4]. In May 2006, through the Executive Resolution 622, the regional executive, in a single act, gave a favorable opinion on the environmental compatibility, environmental impact assessment and landscape authorization for the production of the five wells already drilled [5]. Subsequently, on September 19, 2006, through the Executive Resolution No. 1363, the framework agreement between the Basilicata Region - Total Italia S.p.a. (co-holder to the extent of 50 per cent), Shell Italiana E&P S.p.a. (co-holder to the extent of 25 per cent) and Esso Italiana S.r.l. (co-holder to the extent of 25 per cent) regarding the oil concession named ""Gorgoglione"" was approved. The agreement, among other things, provided that the compensation for the loss of alternative use of the territory and for the reintegration of environmental and territorial balance would take place through an economic contribution from the co-holders of the field and the free supply of natural gas to the municipalities affected by the plants: Corleto Perticara, Guardia Perticara and Laurenzana [6]. In July 2012, following the obtaining of all the necessary authorizations at the regional and national level for the development of the project, Total E&P Italia, together with the other partners, confirmed the final investment decision for the operational development of Tempa Rossa, amounting to 1.6 billion euros. After the initial work carried out in the second half of 2012, site preparation activities officially started in 2013 [2]. Local organizations and committees have been opposed to drilling in this area since 2000, also in light of the negative experiences associated with extraction in the nearby Val D'Agri. The Lucana Environmentalist Organization (OLA) began providing information concurrently with the project's inception, denouncing the lack of environmental protection and citizen involvement. The Upper Sauro Valley is one of the most depressed areas of Basilicata, with a strong tendency towards depopulation; the oil exploitation has not brought significant job opportunities for the local inhabitants, and has also compromised the agro-pastoral vocation of the area and the tourism linked to its natural beauty. In 2009, the committees requested the suspension of the construction of the oil center due to insufficient guarantees for the environment and health, and in 2011, OLA submitted an observation on the environmental impact assessment of the oil center, which foresaw the first refining of crude oil and the emission of harmful substances into the air (O, SO2, NOx, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 Particles, H2S, benzene, IPA, VOCs, heavy metals), for which continuous air quality monitoring was necessary. In 2013, OLA established the independent ""Tempa Rossa"" Observatory with the aim of monitoring the institutional decisions and those of the oil companies, taken within the ""Gorgoglione"" oil concession of Total and Shell, and to collect and share informative materials, reports and independent studies on the complex issues associated with the oil activity in the area [7]. Among the main issues identified were the lack of a possibility for committees and citizens to engage with local institutions and with the Basilicata region, which effectively excluded the population from the decisions taken. In 2013, the regional government authorized Total to conduct new seismic surveys involving the use of explosives in a seismic area that is fragile from a hydrogeological perspective and prone to landslides [8]. In 2014, there were a series of expropriations of land belonging to private individuals in the municipalities of Corleto and Guardia Perticara, since many landowners refused to give up their land to Total. In July 2014, some residents of the municipalities affected by the project blocked the main arteries to reach the Total sites. Not only have the local communities of Basilicata mobilized on the issue. The project also had an extra-regional dimension, as the oil extracted from the Gorgoglione field and transported to the port of Taranto, in Puglia, through the existing Viggiano-Taranto pipeline, would require the construction of two new tanks, each of which would hold 180,000 cubic meters and would be located in the port of Taranto, in Puglia (To further explore the issue of Taranto, see the sheet on the ENI Refinery Atlas) [9][10]. In March 2016, an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Potenza, which was divided into two lines of inquiry and initiated in 2013 by the DDA (District Anti-Mafia Department), highlighted issues relating to Tempa Rossa: there were irregularities in the awarding of contracts and work for the infrastructure of the Tempa Rossa field of Total. In this latter line of investigation, the figure of Gianluca Gemelli, an entrepreneur and partner of the Minister of Economic Development Federica Guidi, emerged as central, as he allegedly managed to obtain a favorable amendment that had previously been rejected in the Unlock Italy decree and then resurfaced in the Stability Law [11]. However, a year after the investigation, in January 2017, the Rome Public Prosecutor's Office requested the closure of the investigation [12]. In August 2017, in light of the difficulties with the Taranto part of the project, Total proposed a plan B: on August 1, the Ministry of the Environment initiated the verification procedure for the submission of an environmental impact assessment presented by Raffineria di Roma spa, which involves ""making plant modifications at the Pantano di Grano depot for the implementation of a system for receiving, storing and exporting crude oil extracted from the Tempa Rossa fields."" In particular, it ""envisages the possibility of ensuring the weekly transit of approximately 22,950 cubic meters of crude oil from the oil treatment center in Corleto di Perticara in Basilicata. The transfer of the crude oil will take place via tanker trucks and isocontainers, with a maximum estimated daily number of 170 vehicles with a capacity of 30 cubic meters, which will be loaded with 27 cubic meters. From the Pantano di Grano depot, the crude oil will then be sent, through the coastal area of Fiumicino, by ship using the existing infrastructure"" [13][14].",estrazione-di-idrocarburi-total-tempa-rossa-italy,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"This is a case in which a community has to defend itself against both drug cartels and a mining company. The cartels demand payments from them and the mining company does not pay them the royalties owed. In the midst of this, community leaders like Agustín Villanueva. There has been bloody repression and imprisonments. Ternium launched a campaign against community leaders a few years ago.  In 2013, there were imprisonments of social leaders related to land grabbing to extract resources. Just released in 2017, after four years in prison, Agustín Villanueva, a community police officer in Aquila, recounted his version of the violence against the communities: first it was drug trafficking, today it is mining.  A false accusation of kidnapping kept this initiator of the self-defense movement and former president of communal assets imprisoned for four years and two months. His arrest took place in August 2013 during the first security operation to disarm the self-defense groups that rose up against the cartel of ""Los Caballeros Templarios"". That day, eight community members were killed and 41 more detained along with Agustín and his brothers Efraín and Vicente.  ""Because the date came when we could no longer stand it because they charged us a fee. They charged us for letting us work in our community... We were all threatened, ruined, no one wanted to work because their meager earnings had to pay a fee, which was a fee to the Templars, because if you didn't pay the Templars, the Jalisco Cartel would come, which was a heavier group than the Templars, damn it! we said, what is that? We couldn't stand it anymore and we had to do what we did"". That year when the Villanueva brothers were arrested, The Caballeros Templarios already had control of the sierra and the coast of Michoacán, a situation that changed in 2014 when the community members of Santa María Ostula took up arms, managed to recover their territory and expel the cartel. To Agustín, upon his release from the High Security Social Reintegration Center for High Impact Crime in Morelia, the community members assure him that the town is now at peace, but he knows that the Aquila mine is a topic that puts the community at risk, since the payment of royalties of more than 18,000 pesos per month to the Ternium Las Encinas company for the extraction of iron ore agreed upon in 2012, is not being respected.  Precisely because of that 2012 royalty collection agreement for the mine, the persecution against Agustín, leader of the self-defense groups in Aquila, began and the crimes that landed him in prison were fabricated. He does not rule out that the situation will be repeated, he is uncomfortable for the interests of the miners. ""It is very dangerous for the reason that the mining company Ternium is stealing the mineral from the Aquila community. They have permission to exploit only 73 hectares in the federal government and with the community, but they are turning the surface of temporary occupation of the 383 hectares into exploitation without the permission of the community and without the permission of the federal government. The danger we are living is that the mining company fabricates accusations against the people who defend their colleagues, they fabricated 12 accusations against me and could not prove any of them but unjustly I spent 4 years in prison"".  After the release on bail of the Villanueva brothers, the persecution and criminalization of the leaders of the community police in the Sierra Costa de Michoacán intensified. The most recent strategy of the federal and state governments to dismantle the movement is the fabrication of crimes of kidnapping, fuel theft, organized crime, money laundering, and terrorism.  A document taped to the door of the Municipal Presidency of Aquila was the way in which the Attorney General's Office (PGR) notified of the arrest warrant issued against several community leaders. In response, the Citizen Council for the Security of the Free and United Municipalities of the Sierra-Costa de Michoacán installed a sit-in on the Lazaro Cardenas highway at the intersection with the road that leads to the municipal seat of Aquila, at the point known as Triquis, to demand an end to the harassment, an end to the fabrication of false crimes, and the withdrawal of charges.  ""They are not self-defense groups, they are our guardians. Let the state not interfere with our peace, honestly we are more afraid of the state than of the criminals"" said a businessman who is a member of the Citizen Council and requested anonymity.  For the community members and businessmen of Aquila, Coahuayana, Chinicuila, Coalcomán, and Tepalcatepec, the attempts to dismantle the self-defense movement by criminalizing the leaders are centered on the interest of appropriating the natural resources of the Michoacán sierra-coast. ""They want to decapitate us because they want the beaches, they want the mining, they want everything on the Michoacán coast. Why don't they let us live in peace?"" says another member of the Citizen Council. The region is rich in terms of mineral, forest, and coastal resources and is also key because of the communication between the ports of Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacán, and Manzanillo, Colima. This has meant that for decades the area has been plundered of its natural resources, clear examples are the illegal logging of precious woods such as sangüalica, which has been cut down in the entire coastal area since 2012 to be sent to the Chinese and Asian markets, as well as the extraction of minerals such as iron, quartz, blue stone, and others from the Aquila mine, which was controlled by Los Templarios for many years. In 2018, the conflict resurfaced between the comuneros and the mining company in Aquila over a disagreement in the concession of 217 hectares of communal lands. Representatives of the Italian-Argentine company argued that they no longer have room to place the mineral waste, so the extraction of iron was reduced by 80 percent, so that each comunero who received between 15 and 18 thousand pesos monthly in royalties, this month only received a check for 5 thousand pesos, reported one of the comuneros, Juan Hernández.  More than 300 farmers gathered in assembly to analyze the way forward, because they do not want to make ""rash decisions"" and give up the mineral in those 217 hectares for 10 years, to which must be added 383 hectares granted six years ago, where about 15 thousand tons are extracted daily and taken to Manzanillo and different parts of the world. Juan Hernández stated that ""The consortium pressures us with the reduction of iron extraction and the argument it is giving is false, since it has enough land to place the mineral waste, it wants us to sign as soon as possible as a condition for the exploitation of the mine to normalize.""  He recalled that from the same company, political strategies have arisen that have divided the comuneros in order to pay as little as possible in royalties. ""... it was thanks to a movement led by Agustín Villanueva Ramírez that they managed to get these to exceed 15 thousand pesos monthly for each comunero,"" he detailed.  He recounted that Villanueva Ramírez was charged with kidnapping and theft by the same company that kept him in prison, along with two colleagues, from August 2013 to October 2017; in fact, he had already been sentenced to 47 years in prison.""",ternium-vs-comuneros-aquila-michoacan-mexico,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Enbridge, a Canadian-based pipeline company, recently constructed a new natural gas compression station, currently under operation in North Weymouth, Massachusetts. There has been significant opposition to this project as it is located in a densely populated area with two state-designated environmental justice communities and presents both environmental and safety concerns [1].  Constructed as part of the Atlantic Bridge Project, the station connects existing pipeline systems, transporting gas from Pennsylvania and other eastern gas fields to Maine and Canada. This station's primary function is to increase pressure and make transporting gas over longer distances more efficient. One of the company's justifications for the project was that it would provide gas for heating local homes; however, major utility companies in the area contest this, stating the station was not necessary to their operations [1][2].  First proposed in 2015, the company conducted a number of assessments, acquired permits from various state and federal regulatory agencies, and selected the site after considering a number of alternatives [1][3].  The location of the site has been the primary concern. The Weymouth station is positioned in the ""most densely populated location ever [for a compressor] in a coastal area in the United States,"" with about 3,200 people per square mile [1][4]. Within 1.5 miles of the site are a number of schools (3,000+ students), housing for the elderly, nursing homes, a mental health facility, and the Fore River Bridge (heavily trafficked by 30,000 commuters per day) [1][2]. The combined population of the two cities closest to the compressor site is approximately 150,000, many of whom are at risk for environmental and health concerns [24]. Additionally, two Environmental Justice state-designated communities are within close proximity to the site. Furthermore, these communities are already disproportionately impacted by pollution from other industrial activities in the area [1].  Another major concern is the negative health impact on the surrounding community from methane and volatile organic compound emissions. The venting of these pollutants occurs during ""blowdowns"" (part of the normal functioning process to relieve pressure), through leaks, and most notably during unplanned releases (potentially affecting N. Weymouth, S. Quincy, Germantown, and other surrounding areas) [1]. In the year since the station has been operating, there have been four unplanned large releases of gas: September 11th, 2020 (169,000 cu ft), September 30th, 2020 (195,000 cu ft), April 6th, 2021 (11,430 cu ft), and May 20th, 2021 (11,000 cu ft) [1, 5, 2]. The company refused to take responsibility for the most recent release in May, declaring it out of their control as a ""force majeure,"" or ""an act of God."" The company then failed to conduct a root cause analysis or safety inspection of the compressor station [2]. From a global perspective, the compressor and pipeline it supports contribute to climate change both directly through methane leaks, and indirectly through CO2 emissions when natural gas is used by consumers. The extraction of this gas via fracking is problematic, presenting additional emission leaks and site pollution. Such a significant infrastructure investment also hinders efforts to transition to cleaner energy alternatives. Instead, the project increases dependency on fossil fuels [2].  The compressor also presents the risk of significant water and ground pollution. Designated as a toxic waste site by the state, the land on which the station is constructed consists of industrial landfill waste from a time when there were regulations in place for their containment and safe disposal. The site was additionally used as a dumping ground for toxic coal ash, and a storage site for an 11.2 million gallon above-ground leaky diesel fuel tank [1][6][7]. As a result, tests conducted on the dirt and groundwater by Enbridge revealed the presence of arsenic, multiple hydrocarbon compounds, coal ash, diesel fuel, and heavy metals among other contaminants in troubling levels [7][8]. This pollution increases the possibility of community and employee exposure every time the ground is disturbed during construction. The known risk of cancer and neurological development issues upon exposure to these contaminants is an added threat for a community already facing higher rates of cancer, pediatric asthma and cardiovascular/respiratory diseases [1][7].   Additionally, the compressor's close proximity to the water presents the risk of pollution leaking into the Weymouth Fore River which surrounds the site. The increase in pressure that the station creates for existing underwater pipelines running under the river also raises the likelihood of leaks directly into the water [9]. The area is prone to flooding even with moderate storms, which among a number of other risks, increases the likelihood of the compressor's explosion. Although relatively rare, past instances of stations operating at a tenth of the pressure have resulted in devastating results [1]. The town's emergency plan does not include provisions for schools in the area, making any attempt at evacuation in response to such an event challenging [10][28]. The site also raises a number of other issues surrounding ecological impacts (e.g. annual herring run), noise pollution, traffic impacts, and negative economic effects (such as decreases in property values) [4]. Primary opposition comes from the community surrounding the compressor. Fore River Residents Against the Compressor Station (FRRACS) is the main group representing this population's concerns. Since the site's first proposal they have helped lead a number of actions, such as in-person protests. Two notable ones included a protest in October 2020 held on the Fore River Bridge, and another in December 2019 at which there were four arrests made for blocking trucks from entering the site [3][11]. The group has developed an online presence, using their website ""www.nocompressor.com"" to raise public awareness, share detailed information on their concerns, conduct additional media outreach, and highlight other sources discussing the topic such as podcasts/news articles. They have also been influential in helping to organize the opposition in a number of ways; publishing information about upcoming events, and encouraging other avenues of action (participation in letters to involved agencies/gov. actors, etc.). The group also pushed for a station to monitor air pollution from the compressor that was successfully installed in the spring of 2021 [12][13]. Data from the monitor is publicly accessible and has already shown the presence of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particulate matter in the air near the site [17].  A number of national and state environmental groups have also mobilized against the project, including Mothers Out Front, the Sunrise Movement, the Sierra Club of Massachusetts, and 350 Mass For A Better Future. Additionally, all major local elected officials have expressed their opposition including senators and congressmen, with Governor Baker being a notable exception [1].  Some US and state policies are in support of increased fossil fuel infrastructure development as a result of their interest in a strengthened economy, energy reliability, and independence. Natural gas companies have run a successful campaign portraying natural gas as a cleaner, even environmentally friendly fossil fuel alternative. This narrative has been widely disputed by scientists and environmental organizations due to concerns around pipeline leaks among other things. However, other policies stand to regulate and decrease investments in this industry in order to preserve safety, public health, and the environment. As a result, in the compressor's construction and operation, Enbridge had to comply with a number of different regulations [1]. As one of the many governmental agencies involved, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) approved the necessary air quality, wetlands, and waterways permits for the project [1]. Additionally, under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30 §§ 61-62I) Enbridge was required to conduct a review of the environmental impact of the project. Ultimately the Secretary of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs determined that in this case, the less rigorous Environmental Assessment (EA) was sufficient as it provides ""meaningful opportunities for public review, analyzes alternatives, and considers cumulative impacts"" [30]. FRRACS disagreed but was denied a more in-depth Environmental Impact Report (EIR) [9]. Once the company had acquired all the required permits, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is in charge of interstate energy projects, provided their final approval for the Weymouth station on September 24th, 2020 (less than two weeks after a large unplanned release of gas from the compressor) [15]. As a result of these unplanned releases, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) paused the startup of the station until it was able to conduct a federal safety investigation [16].  The compressor station passed the federal investigation and has been operational since it first opened on January 23, 2021 [16]. A number of ongoing issues, as predicted, have come to light, including gas releases which have led to four shutdowns of the station and the excavation of pipes in August to add additional protection from saltwater corrosion [18]. Community groups and activists have continued to organize, with FRRACS pushing for the station to be closed permanently. They have attended meetings and court cases and even occupied a local Enbridge office [19]. Despite their efforts, those impacted have been granted no significant remediation efforts, and the station remains open.  Enbridge is a $170 billion company and is currently responsible for transporting 19% of all natural gas used in the US [1]. As a result, it has significant economic and political influence in the country. In addition, a number of towns received controversial payments from Enbridge, including Weymouth who dropped their legal opposition soon after obtaining $10 million in October 2020, with a potential for an additional $28 million [20].  The U.S. natural gas transmission network includes more than 279,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and approximately 1,790 compressors. With these stations producing an estimated 50.7 billion cubic feet of methane emissions annually and being often sited in already disadvantaged communities, the issues identified as part of this Enbridge project are not exclusive to the Weymouth compressor. However, the Biden administration's greater emphasis on environmental protection and the appointment of a new FERC commissioner has led to FERC reviewing the project, specifically examining Environmental Justice concerns, and presenting the possibility of a shutdown [21] for this site and hopefully others.",north-weymouth-natural-gas-compressor,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"In 2006 the Swedish company SEKAB signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Tanzania to cultivate 20,000 hectares of sugar cane for the European biofuel market. The area targeted by the company is located 20 km from Bagamoyo town and it was given in 1974 to the Government of Zanzibar by Tanzania's first President for livestock production. The ranch was then closed in 1994 and the land returned under the control of the Tanzanian government. Since then the latter considered the area uninhabited and unused, despite many people have been living there in dependence on forest resources. In 2007 SEKAB chose ORGUT, a Swedish consultancy firm, to conduct the Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ESIA). ORGUT's ESIA found out that more than 1000 people were living within the project's area and showed some critical issues such as a huge water requirement, the possible loss of biodiversity and common resources, including the wildlife in the nearby Saadani National Park, rising conflicts between communities, the increase of communicable diseases, as HIV and malaria, due to the influx of workers and the growing of social interactions. Despite these risks, SEKAB altered ORGUT's conclusions and submitted a revisited and softened version of ESIA to the National Environmental Management Council, which was approved in 2008. Before starting any operations, SEKAB in 2009 sold the project to the Swedish company AgroEcoEnergy as a consequence of the international crisis and lack of funds. The new company revisited the project by planning the production of sugar cane for the local market and the production of ethanol for the generation and supply of electricity. The African Development Bank Group accepted to provide secure funding for this project on the condition that the ADBG's Involuntary Resettlement Policy and the International Financial Corporation's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability were complied by AgroEcoEnergy. Both standards encourage investors to avoid resettlement whenever possible or to minimized negative impacts if resettlement is unavoidable. The company mandated in 2010 International Development Consultants Limited to carry out the first Resettlement Action Plan in accordance with funders' standards. The RAP identified 1374 people to be affected by the project and eligible for compensation. Since the Government didn't recognize people's land rights, the company would have had to cover the full cost of compensation and resettlement, causing the slowing down of the project. After a year of negotiation, the Government decided to act as if the land was legally occupied and, according the Land Laws of 1999, recognized 815 people eligible for compensations. This census didn't include all those impacted by project like Barbaig pastoralists or the illegal charcoal makers. Moreover, the Land Laws only provide monetary compensation and fail to comply with the funders' standards. For this reason, the company was supposed to bear the costs of providing new houses and land for those living in the area. In 2013 Ecoenergy acquired a derivative right of occupancy for 99-years, but in June 2016 Tanzanian government took the decision to halt the project. Action Aid considered this a ""victory"" for vulnerable local communities and for the surrounding wildlife.  As reported some months earlier in The Guardian (21 October 2015), Per Carstedt, executive chairman of the Swedish company Agro EcoEnergy, had a dream for  land on the north Tanzanian coast,  a dream quite similater to that proposed for the Tana Delta in Kenya by other investors. Under his firm's plan, farmers who once depended on subsistence work would earn wages on a sugarcane plantation or from selling sugarcane they grow to a sugar mill. The factory wouldl process sugar for export as well as for ethanol. The fields would be crisscrossed with irrigation canals and treated with a mix of organic and synthetic fertiliser. Within a few years, Tanzania would be the biggest sugar producer in theEast African Community. Carstedt was adamant that large-scale farming projects are central to meeting Africa's rising food needs. ""What can a smallholder do if he doesn't have access to infrastructure, access to market, access to training? Well, he does what he's done for generations – produce the food he needs to survive,"" Carstedt said, speaking to The Guardian in his office halfway between the project area of Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam.  However, the shelving of the project in 2016 had been foreseen in the financial press. Thus The Economist Intelligence Unit had reported on 2 June 2015 that the proposed US$620m sugar project in Bagamoyo (some 75 km north of Dar es Salaam) faced an uncertain future, following the decision by a number of key backers to withdraw their financial commitments.",agro-ecoenergy,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO

"The proposed Tanintharyi National Park is part of a series of conservation zones planned to be established in Southern Myanmar. The project has caused severe concerns over social and livelihood impacts on indigenous forest dwellers. A group of civil society organizations, called the Conservation Alliance of Tanawthari (CAT), launched a report in Feburary 2018 entitled ""Our Forest, Our Life"" that examines the threats of conservation to customary forest users. The report [see 1] documents the vital role of the affected people in maintaining and protecting the biodiverse environment and demands that they must not be excluded from the forest area proposed to be turned into a National Park.The Tanintharyi National Park was proposed in 2002 and covers an area of about 207,000 ha [2]. It is comprised of unique habitats and is home to many large mammals, such as sambar deer, Asian elephants, red gorals, leopards and many other species [2]. The area has also been home to many indigenous Karen communities who have relied on biodiverse shifting cultivation, hunting and gathering, fishing, paddy farming and livestock raising for their livelihoods. While the boundaries of the park have already been demarcated, the plans to establish the park have been recently stalled, states the report, and the conservation areas was dropped from the Ridge to Reef project – a large-scale conservation project in Tanintharyi region that has the aim of securing long-term biodiversity protection. There are however fears of revival of the plans in the context of the establishment of a massive biodiversity conservation zone and corridor across the Tenasserim Hills of Tanintharyi [1].The park would threaten indigenous communities who have been living within the boundaries, says CAT, if the plans for the park are revived [1]. According to the report, there are 42 villages with a population of ca. 14,181 people located within the boundaries of the proposed conservation zone, of which most of them have not been properly informed. 30 of these villages are predominantly of Karen ethnicity and some of them are more than 200 years old [1]. The establishment of the Park as a Protected Area would turn the forest into an exclusionary zone, designated under the 1994 Protection of Wildlife and Conservation of Natural Areas Law. According to the law, local communities would have no access rights to the core zone of the protected area, which poses severe risks on their livelihoods. People caught conducting traditional subsistence activities within the core zone would have to face fines or could be arrested [see 1]. During the civil war, about 33 of the villages located within the conservation zone were abandoned and many of them destroyed, documents the report. Since 2014, some of the villagers who had to flee during the armed conflict have started to return to their old lands many more are likely to follow over the coming years. The establishment of the National Park would threaten the right of the internally displaced people (IDPs) to return to their homelands, says the civil society alliance [1]. Moreover, the government-controlled National Park proposal located in areas of mixed administration between the Myanmar Union Government and the Karen National Union (KNU) threatens a fragile peace process between the parties and has led to rising tensions [1]. Social mobilizations against the expansion of top-down conservation zones and for the support of indigenous biodiversity conservation have arisen, as seen through the Conservation Alliance of Tanawthari (CAT) - a coalition of seven Karen civil society groups founded in 2014. Their report launched in early 2018 received wide press coverage [e.g., 3,4,5] and documented how customary land and resource management practices of Karen communities are effective ways of maintaining and conserving the unique habitat and species biodiversity. Known as 'Kaw', this resource use system is based on the culture and tradition of Karen livelihoods and contains specified rules for resource use, monitoring, sanctioning and dispute resolution among community members. The customary land use system has a proven record of protecting high conservation value forests, they say [1] (see also 6,7). Villagers living within the proposed conservation area have also actively protected the forest area from conversion to industrial cash crops. In 2014, the Myanmar Maha Da Nan company proposed to plant 68,000 acres (ca. 27,000 ha) of rubber and oil palm within the high conservation value forest close to Htee Wa Sha Gone (Para Ku) village. About one year later, in 2015, the Myeik A Mya Pai company proposed a 100,000 acre (ca. 40,000 ha) biofuel plantation. In both cases, the villagers united to oppose the projects and the companies were not able to develop their plans, the report informs [1].Instead of a top-down, centralized large-scale conservation approach, driven by international conservation organizations, groups call for biodiversity conservation led by indigenous communities and their sustainable resource uses (see proposed alternatives, below, and for instance 6,7). ""Conservation organizations working in Tanintharyi have so far failed to acknowledge the importance of Karen communities as forest defenders in protecting forest resources from outside incursions"" (1, page 25).",tanintharyi-national-park-proposed-threatens-indigenous-communities-myanmar,NÃO,SIM,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,NÃO,NÃO
"Australia's Lynas Rare Earth Ltd. (formerly known as Lynas Corporation) mines rare earth ore in Western Australia, which it transports to a secondary processing plant in the port city of Kuantan Malaysia.  On March 8, 2011, a New York Times article revealed construction of a world-scale rare earth (RE) secondary processing plant in an industrial estate in Gebeng, near the Port of Kuantan, Malaysia. The plant is 100% owned by Australia's Lynas Rare Earth Ltd. (formerly known as Lynas Corporation), which owns and operates a mine and concentration plant in Mt Weld (Western Australia, WA)— 800km from WA's capital, Perth — shipping the ore concentrate 2,899 nautical miles (5,370 km) from Fremantle Port to the Kuantan plant for extraction and processing into RE oxides. In 1992, the WA government granted Lynas's predecessor Ashton Rare Earth Limited conditional approval for a processing plant in Meenaar industrial estate 100km from Perth [1]. Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia approval stipulated numerous social and environmental conditions [2]. Mt Weld and Meenaar are ideal mining and refining sites —sparsely populated semi-arid lands with underground aquifers capable of supplying amber water. Choosing, instead, a Malaysian site, Lynas could avoid the stringent Meenaar conditions set by the WA government.Today, LAMP is about 2 km from a residential population of 30,000 and 700,000 people live within a 5km and 25 km radius (including Kuantan city with over 400,000) respectively.Malaysia's last RE refinery, Asian Rare Earth (ARE) in neighbouring state of Perak, left a toxic legacy involving Asia's biggest RE clean-up effort costing $100 million [3]. Partly owned and operated by Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical in the industrial town Bukit Merah, nearby villagers and workers experienced miscarriages, birth defects and unusually high incidence of childhood leukaemia due to poor management of toxic and radioactive wastes, lack of occupational and public health and safety measures, and government inaction despite independent scientific evidence of dangers. ARE closed down in 1992 after 10 years of operation and strong popular actions and protests [4]. A peat mangrove [5] — theoretically protected by law [6] — sits adjacent to the Lynas refinery. The Lynas refinery went ahead without public knowledge, consultation or impact assessment on the peatland, its biologically rich estuary and floodplains, and the marine and coastal ecosystems of the South China Sea, just 5 km from the refinery [7]. Pitched as a 'green' supplier of materials for low-emission technologies vital to tackling climate change, it is ironic that Lynas has located its refinery in this rich tropical peatland, which stores huge amount of carbon dioxide emitted whenever burnt in the drought season, exposed or disturbed. Instead, this landscape should be protected for mitigating climate change and offering adaptive ecosystem services to local communities [8] [9]. Malaysia's biggest ever environmental campaign [10] — described as the country's ""most far reaching experience with a popular environmental resistance"" [11] — evolved as local, Australian and international environmentalists became alarmed by the secrecy surrounding the refinery, the fast-tracked approval, a 12-year tax break granted Lynas as a Malaysian government foreign direct investment incentive, the vulnerable social and ecological environment in which the refinery had been placed and prior experience of tragedies with Bukit Merah [12][13].On May 15, 2011, about 100 people organised by DAP Kuantan gathered at the refinery to demonstrate before police moved in to arrest four individuals stretched out on a banner showing a radioactive symbol. The four were DAP Pahang publicity secretary Chow Yu Hui, organising secretary Lee Chin Chen, Khor Hui Ying and Thing Siew Shuen [23].On June 22, 2014, thousands of protestors organized by NGO Himpunan Hijau ( ̈green assembly ̈) gathered outside the Kuantan facility when guards began violently disrupting the crowd. 16 protestors including Australian-based activist Natalie Lowrey were arrested and detained in a Kuantan prison while two others were hospitalized after guards beat them. Her arrest became high-profile, inciting worldwide protests and a petition signed by 15,000 people calling for her release [21] [22]. In December 2018, a newly elected government demanded that Lynas ship back its refinery waste to Australia by September 2019 or else they would not have their license renewed. This caused the company ́s stock price to fall by more than half [20]. In August 2019, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad extended Lynas ́operating license by 3 years under the condition that Lynas stop importing radioactive materials by July 2023 [25]. In response, protestors continued mobilizing, such as chemical enginer turned activist Moses Lim, who brings up concerns that ""[The radioactivity] will be passed through our children and our children's children [24].On April 28, 2021, thanks to the joint efforts of Save Malaysia Stop Lynas (SMSL), Sahabat Alam Malaysia (Friends of the Earth), Aid/Watch Australia and political parties such as the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM), Lynas failed an environmental impact analysis for a proposal to build a permanent toxic and radioactive waste dump in a water catchment in a rainforest reserve. The proposed waste dump would be sited in a forest on Bukit Ketam that feeds two rivers that Kuantan uses to supply 90% of the population with drinking water [25].However, a new site in a peat swamp is now being developed for the waste dump.  The dump has been awarded to a company GSSB owned by the Regent of Pahang.  GSSB has no experience in building a municipal landfill, let alone a radioactive waste dump that requires scientifically robust isolation of the hazardous materials of the waste.  Aid/Watch and Malaysian groups are advocating for the 1+ million tones of radioactive waste to be removed  from Malaysia.  Under Western Australian guideline for this type of waste, Lynas must return it to its mine site in Mt Weld to be managed under a low-level radioactive waste management plan.",lynas-refinery-in-kuantan,SIM,NÃO,NÃO TENHO CERTEZA,SIM,SIM
